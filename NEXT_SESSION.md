## NEXT SESSION PROMPT

I'm working on the **Storehouse website** (storehouse-website).

**Context:**
- Full content alignment pass complete (2026-02-17): CIS updated, all 17 articles + FAQ reviewed and revised
- Joseph Principle consistent across all content ("margin for life's uncertainty," seasons language, God credited)
- Competitor names removed from all editorial content (approach-based language only)
- YNAB article reframed to "Coming to Storehouse from Zero-Based Budgeting" (1 SEO mention)
- Debt article restructured: 4-tier hierarchy (debt is a bill)
- Categories messaging aligned: "auto-categorize for awareness, no category budgets"
- All blog posts have `author: "JR"` frontmatter
- Build passes, 28 pages

**Remaining website items:**
- **Waitlist-to-CTA conversion** -- Randy will decide timing. All "Join Waitlist" / "launching soon" language needs updating when app beta is ready. Touches ~15 files.
- Visual review on dev server / preview deployment
- Deploy to production (Vercel)

**From the realignment plan (future sessions, app-side):**
- Phase 4: Fix V1 app bugs (oops buffer, biblical terms toggle, stale warning) -- in storehouse repo
- Phase 5: Build onboarding flow -- in storehouse repo
- Phase 6: Generate new screenshots for homepage visual variety
- Phase 7: Beta readiness pass (align all website claims with app reality)

**WORKFLOW:**
1. Read PROGRESS.md and NEXT_SESSION.md
2. Choose focus area (CTA update, visual QA, or app-side work)
3. Implement changes
4. Verify with `npm run build`
5. Commit with proper prefixes

STOP CONDITION: After completing the chosen focus area.
- Do NOT start app-side work unless Randy directs it
- Do NOT switch CTAs without Randy's direction on timing and wording
