# NEXT SESSION PROMPT

I'm working on the Storehouse Website (`projects/storehouse-website/`).

**Context:**
- All 12 Foundations articles are written, reviewed, polished, and committed on `feat/design-improvements`
- Build passes clean (24 pages including 12 article pages + foundations index)
- Every article passed Content Integrity System review (PUBLISH_READY)
- Blog has 1 remaining post (margin-for-freelancers.md)
- Content reviews are in docs/content-review/ (12 review files total)

**WORKFLOW:**
1. Read `projects/storehouse-website/PROGRESS.md`
2. Push `feat/design-improvements` to origin
3. Deploy to Vercel preview and visually review:
   - Foundations index page (hero, featured article, 4 pillar sections, blog preview, CTA)
   - All 12 individual article pages (pillar theming, same-pillar navigation)
   - Navigation (Foundations in header, mobile nav, footer)
   - Blog index (cross-link banner to Foundations, 1 remaining post)
4. Fix any visual issues found during review
5. If satisfied, merge to main and deploy to production
6. Move `docs/plans/proposed/storehouse-content-canon.md` to `docs/plans/completed/`
7. Update PROGRESS.md

**STOP CONDITION:** After deploying to production, your work is DONE.
- Do NOT start new content projects in the same session
- Do NOT modify the Content Integrity System
- Do NOT touch any other projects

**BEFORE ENDING, provide:**
1. Summary of what was deployed
2. Any visual issues found and fixed
3. **NEXT SESSION PROMPT** for next project work
