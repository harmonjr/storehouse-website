# NEXT SESSION PROMPT

I'm working on the **Storehouse website** (storehouse-website project).

**Context:**
- PR #3 is open on `feat/content-gaps` branch with all content gaps work
- Content reviewers were launched and should have written review files to `docs/content-review/`
- 5 new/rewritten articles need review feedback applied if NEEDS_REVISION
- Build passes clean at 28 pages
- Pillar balance is now 3/3/4/4 (Margin/Clarity/Order/Peace)

**WORKFLOW:**
1. Read `PROGRESS.md` for current state
2. Check `docs/content-review/` for review verdicts on the 5 articles
3. If any are NEEDS_REVISION, apply the suggested changes
4. Commit any fixes to `feat/content-gaps` and push
5. Deploy to preview and do visual review
6. Merge PR #3 to main
7. Move `docs/plans/proposed/misty-munching-feather.md` to `docs/plans/completed/`
8. Update PROGRESS.md

**STOP CONDITION:** After merging PR #3 and moving the plan to completed, your work is DONE.
- Do NOT start new content or features
- Do NOT modify hub infrastructure

**BEFORE ENDING, provide:**
1. Summary of what was completed
2. Any issues or blockers encountered
3. **NEXT SESSION PROMPT** for the following phase
