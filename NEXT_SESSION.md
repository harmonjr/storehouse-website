# NEXT SESSION PROMPT

I'm working on the Storehouse Website (`projects/storehouse-website/`).

**Context:**
- Foundations page and 3 Tier 1 articles are committed on `feat/design-improvements` (2 commits ahead of origin)
- Build passes clean (15 pages)
- All 3 articles passed Content Integrity System review (PUBLISH_READY)
- 9 Tier 2 articles remain as coming-soon placeholders
- Blog has 1 remaining post (margin-for-freelancers.md)

**WORKFLOW:**
1. Read `projects/storehouse-website/PROGRESS.md` and `LESSONS_LEARNED.md`
2. Push `feat/design-improvements` to origin
3. Deploy to Vercel preview and visually review:
   - Foundations index page (hero, featured article, 4 pillar sections, blog preview, CTA)
   - 3 individual article pages (pillar theming, same-pillar nav)
   - Navigation (Foundations in header, mobile nav, footer)
   - Blog index (cross-link banner to Foundations, 1 remaining post)
4. Fix any visual issues found during review
5. If satisfied, merge to main and deploy to production
6. Begin Tier 2 articles (start with #4 "The Weekly Ritual" and #5 "Setting Your Hierarchy")

**STOP CONDITION:** After deploying Foundations to production, your work is DONE for this session.
- Do NOT start Tier 2 articles in the same session as deployment
- Do NOT modify the Content Integrity System
- Do NOT touch any other projects

**BEFORE ENDING, provide:**
1. Summary of what was deployed
2. Any visual issues found and fixed
3. **NEXT SESSION PROMPT** for Tier 2 article writing
