We found $73 a month in subscriptions we'd forgotten about.

Not subscriptions we were using and decided to cancel. Subscriptions we didn't know we were paying for. A language-learning app one of us tried for two weeks in January. A cloud storage upgrade we'd made for a project that ended months ago. A streaming service we'd signed up for to watch one show and never opened again.

Seventy-three dollars a month. That's $876 a year. For nothing. Not for entertainment we enjoyed, not for tools we used -- for the privilege of forgetting to cancel.

We built the subscription detector in Storehouse because of that moment. But you don't need the app to do what we did. You just need three months of bank statements and thirty minutes.

## This Is a Treasure Hunt, Not a Diet

Before we go any further, let's get the framing right. This isn't about deprivation. Nobody is going to tell you to cancel Netflix and sit in the dark. The subscription audit isn't an austerity measure -- it's a treasure hunt.

You're looking for money that's already yours but is leaving your account without your active permission. You signed up once. You stopped using the service. The charge continues. That's not a bill. That's a leak.

The difference matters. Cutting expenses feels like losing something. Reclaiming forgotten subscriptions feels like finding a $20 bill in your coat pocket -- except it's $50 or $100, and it shows up every single month.

## The Audit: Three Steps, Thirty Minutes

Here's the whole process. You can do this right now with nothing but your bank's website and something to write on.

**Step 1: Pull three months of statements.**

Not one month -- three. Some subscriptions are annual. Some are quarterly. Three months catches the recurring patterns that a single month misses. Download or view the last three months of transactions from your bank or credit card.

**Step 2: Flag every recurring charge.**

Go line by line. Anything that appears monthly (or on a regular schedule) gets flagged. Be thorough. You're looking for:

- **Streaming services:** Video, music, podcasts, audiobooks. Most households have three to five. Some have more.
- **Apps and software:** Cloud storage, productivity tools, photo editors, VPNs, password managers.
- **Memberships:** Gym, warehouse clubs, professional associations, subscription boxes.
- **Forgotten trials:** The services that offered "first month free" and have been billing ever since.
- **Bundled charges:** Services tucked inside your phone bill or credit card perks that you're paying for without realizing it.

Write each one down with its monthly cost. Don't skip the small ones. $4.99 feels insignificant until you find six of them.

**Step 3: Apply the test.**

For each subscription on your list, ask one question: **"Would I sign up for this today?"**

Not "do I use it sometimes?" Not "might I need it eventually?" Would you, right now, hand over your credit card and sign up fresh?

If yes, keep it. You're paying for something you value. That's not a leak -- that's a choice.

If no, cancel it. The reason these charges persist is because canceling requires a decision and inertia doesn't. Right now, while you're looking at the number, is the easiest moment to make that call.

If you're unsure, cancel it anyway. Here's why: every subscription you cancel can be restarted. If you cancel a streaming service and miss it two months later, sign up again. You'll have saved two months of charges and confirmed that you actually want it. But most of the time, you won't miss it. You'll forget it existed -- which tells you everything.

## The Math That Changes Your Mind

Small charges feel small because we experience them individually. But they don't hit your account individually. They accumulate.

Here's what a typical forgotten-subscription haul might look like -- not our exact list, but representative of what we hear from others:

| Subscription | Monthly Cost | Annual Cost |
|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| Streaming service (unused) | $15.99 | $191.88 |
| Cloud storage (unneeded tier) | $2.99 | $35.88 |
| Fitness app (abandoned) | $14.99 | $179.88 |
| Meal kit (paused but billing) | $11.99 | $143.88 |
| Language app (forgot about it) | $13.99 | $167.88 |
| News site (reads free tier anyway) | $9.99 | $119.88 |
| Old software subscription | $7.99 | $95.88 |
| **Total** | **$77.93** | **$935.16** |

Nearly a thousand dollars a year. Not from extravagant spending. From charges so small that each one fell below the threshold of attention.

That's the nature of subscription creep. No single charge feels worth the effort to cancel. Together, they're a car payment.

## Where the Found Money Goes

Here's where the audit connects to everything else. You've found $78 a month. What do you do with it?

The instinct is to absorb it into general spending. The money frees up, spending expands to fill it, and three months later you don't notice the difference. That's how lifestyle creep works -- freed resources get consumed by the default.

The hierarchy offers a different path. The Bible teaches that what we have isn't ours to consume but ours to manage faithfully -- stewardship. Found money, then, is an opportunity, not a windfall.

That $78 could increase your giving. If you're at 3% and want to move toward 5%, found subscription money might close the gap. That's $78 a month you weren't using for anything -- now it's doing something meaningful.

It could accelerate your saving. An extra $78 a month is $936 a year. In three years, that's $2,808 -- a meaningful emergency fund built entirely from money you forgot you were spending.

Or it could genuinely increase your Safe-to-Spend. If your hierarchy is already where you want it, that $78 stays in your spending pool -- and now you're spending it on things you actually choose instead of things you forgot to cancel.

Any of those options is stewardship. The subscription audit doesn't just find money. It gives you the chance to decide where it goes instead of letting it leak out unnoticed.

## You Can't Steward What You Can't See

This is the Clarity pillar at work. The best financial intentions mean nothing if you don't know where your money is actually going. The subscription audit isn't glamorous. It isn't going to change your life in a single afternoon. But it does something most financial advice doesn't: it makes the invisible visible.

Those forgotten charges weren't hidden by anyone. They were hidden by inattention. The auto-charge model is designed to reduce friction -- for the company. It makes signing up easy and canceling forgettable. That's good business for them. It's an expensive habit for you.

The audit reverses that. For thirty minutes, you look at every recurring charge and ask whether it deserves to keep withdrawing from your account. That's not obsessive. That's ownership.

## Make It a Habit

The subscription audit isn't a one-time event. New subscriptions accumulate. Free trials convert. Services raise their prices. We do this quarterly -- four times a year, thirty minutes each. Two hours a year to keep the leaks sealed.

If you're doing the weekly import ritual, you'll notice new subscriptions as they appear in your transaction imports. The ritual catches the leaks in real time. The quarterly audit is the deep clean.

Between the two, nothing slips through unnoticed for long.

## One Step You Can Take Today

Open your bank's transaction history. Just the last thirty days. Scan for recurring charges. Write down every subscription you find and its monthly cost. Add them up.

That's your number. The monthly cost of your subscription footprint.

Now circle the ones you'd forgotten about. You don't have to cancel anything right this second -- though if you want to, there's no better time. Just see the number. Let it register. Because the first step toward better stewardship of your money is always the same: see where it's actually going.

You can't steward what you can't see. But once you see it, you get to choose what happens next. That's not austerity. That's freedom.
