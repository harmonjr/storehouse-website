There's a moment every Sunday morning in our house -- right after breakfast, before the day gets away from us -- when we sit down with a cup of coffee and open Storehouse. We download last week's transactions from the bank, import them, and take ten minutes to look at where the money went.

It's not dramatic. It's not stressful. It's ten minutes.

And it's the single most important financial habit we've ever built.

## Why Manual Import Is a Feature, Not a Limitation

Storehouse uses manual bank import. You download a CSV from your bank, upload it to the app, and review the transactions. If you're used to apps that auto-sync your accounts, this probably sounds like a step backward.

It's not. It's the step most people skip.

Auto-sync is a remarkable piece of technology. Your transactions appear like magic -- categorized, tallied, ready for review. The problem is that last part. Ready for review doesn't mean reviewed. And for most people, it never is.

You glance at the numbers, feel a vague sense of "I should look at that more closely," and close the app. The data is there. The attention isn't.

Manual import puts you in the room with your money. You see the transactions arrive. You watch the numbers change. You notice the charge from that subscription you forgot about and the dinner that cost more than you expected. Ten minutes of actual attention replaces months of passive monitoring.

The act of showing up -- downloading, importing, looking -- is what turns data into understanding. You can't steward what you haven't seen.

## The Ritual: What It Actually Looks Like

Here's the whole process. It takes ten minutes, and three of those are waiting for the coffee to cool.

**Step 1: Download your transactions.** Log into your bank, export the last week's activity as a CSV file. Most banks make this two or three clicks. (You'll figure out your bank's process the first time and it becomes muscle memory after that.)

**Step 2: Import to Storehouse.** Upload the file. Storehouse reads the transactions and adds them to your record. This takes about thirty seconds.

**Step 3: Quick review.** Scan the transactions. Does everything look right? Anything you don't recognize? Notice any patterns -- a few too many impulse purchases, or maybe a week where you were more disciplined than you expected?

**Step 4: Check your Safe-to-Spend.** This is the moment. After the hierarchy has done its work -- after giving, saving, and bills have been handled -- what remains? Is the number where you expected it to be? Higher? Lower?

That's it. Four steps. Ten minutes. Done for the week.

## Why Weekly and Not Daily

Some financial advice tells you to check your money daily. We tried that. It was exhausting. Every day felt like a weigh-in -- a new chance to feel good or bad about a number that hadn't changed enough to be meaningful.

Daily checking turns your finances into a mood ring. The number is up, you feel great. The number is down, you worry. Nothing useful happens in that gap, but the anxiety is constant.

Weekly is different. A week is long enough that the numbers tell a real story. You can see patterns: this was a heavier spending week, or a lighter one. You can connect the numbers to your actual life -- the birthday dinner, the grocery run, the tank of gas. The data has meaning because it has context.

Weekly is also sustainable. Most healthy habits that last are weekly. Meal prep. Exercise routines. Family meetings. The practices that shape your life happen on a rhythm, not a sprint. Your money deserves the same kind of steady, sustainable attention.

## The Friction Is the Point

Ten minutes a week. That's a real cost. It's ten minutes you could spend on something else. We know that. We chose it anyway.

Here's why: the friction is what makes it work.

When something costs you nothing, you value it accordingly. Auto-synced financial data is free -- it arrives without effort, and it departs your mind just as easily. Manual import costs ten minutes. That small investment of time creates ownership. You did something. You showed up. The data isn't just sitting in an app -- you put it there, you looked at it, you know what it says.

There's a reason people remember things they write by hand better than things they type. There's a reason cooking a meal feels different from ordering delivery. The act of doing changes your relationship with the outcome.

Ten minutes of intentional attention to your finances does more than twelve months of auto-synced data you never really look at.

## What Actually Happens During the Review

The review isn't just looking at numbers. It's the moment where the hierarchy from [Give First, Save Second, Spend What Remains](/foundations/give-first-save-second-spend-what-remains) stops being a principle and becomes a practice.

You gave this week. You can see it. It's not an idea -- it's a line item.

You saved this week. It's right there, moving from "intention" to "fact."

Your bills are covered. Your Safe-to-Spend reflects reality.

That weekly confirmation is what turns stewardship from something you believe in to something you do. The Bible describes a posture -- that what you have is God's, and your job is to manage it faithfully. Ten minutes a week is where that posture becomes practice. The gap between values and behavior closes in those ten minutes. Not through willpower. Through visibility.

## The Surprising Part

Nobody looks forward to budgeting. It's the thing you know you should do and avoid doing.

But here's what we didn't expect: the weekly ritual becomes something you actually anticipate. Not because you enjoy spreadsheets, but because of what happens after. You close the laptop knowing where you stand. No guessing for the rest of the week. No background anxiety about whether the bills are covered. No vague guilt about spending.

You checked. You know. You're good.

That ten-minute window buys you a week of peace. A week where "can we afford this?" has a simple answer. A week where your Safe-to-Spend number is current and trustworthy and yours.

There's a rhythm to it, like any good practice. The first few weeks feel like effort. By the fourth or fifth week, it feels like maintenance. By the eighth or ninth, it just feels like Sunday morning. Coffee, transactions, peace. Ten minutes.

## One Step You Can Take Today

Pick a day and time. That's the whole step. Sunday morning, Wednesday evening, Saturday after lunch -- it doesn't matter when. What matters is that it's consistent. Block ten minutes on your calendar if that helps. Tell your spouse or partner, "This is our money check-in time."

The ritual isn't complicated. It's not painful. It's ten minutes of attention that replaces a week of uncertainty. The first one might feel like a chore. The third one will feel like a habit. The tenth one will feel like part of your week you wouldn't skip.

Stewardship isn't a one-time decision. It's a practice you keep. And the practice starts with ten minutes, a cup of coffee, and the willingness to look.
