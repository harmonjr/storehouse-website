You want to give first. You believe in the hierarchy. But you're staring at $15,000 in credit card debt and a student loan balance that hasn't moved in three years, and the question won't stop nagging: is it irresponsible to give money away while I owe money to someone else?

The question is honest. It deserves an honest answer. And the honest answer is more nuanced than most financial voices will give you.

## The Two Dominant Views

There are two dominant schools of thought on debt and generosity.

One voice says: stop all giving until the debt is gone. Every dollar toward generosity is a dollar not attacking the balance. You can't afford to be generous right now. Get intense. Cut everything. Pay it off. Then you can give.

The other voice says: tithe no matter what. Ten percent, off the top, regardless of your financial situation. The Bible teaches tithing (Malachi 3:10), and that's non-negotiable.

Both carry real conviction. And both can create guilt -- the first by making generosity feel irresponsible, the second by ignoring the real tension of giving when you're behind.

If you've been caught between these two, you already know the feeling. Whatever you choose, one voice tells you you're wrong.

## A Middle Path

We think there's a third option. It won't fit on a bumper sticker, and it won't satisfy people who want a single rule. But it fits how life actually works.

Maintain a baseline of generosity. Attack high-interest debt aggressively. Build a small emergency buffer so that unexpected expenses don't create more debt. And let the hierarchy hold it all together.

The hierarchy stays the same -- Give, Save, Bills, Safe-to-Spend. Debt doesn't add a new tier. Debt payments are bills. They're obligations you've committed to, and they belong in that tier alongside rent, utilities, and insurance. What changes during a debt season isn't the structure. It's how you use it.

1. **Give** -- baseline (whatever is honest for you right now)
2. **Save** -- build a small buffer ($500-$1,000), then pause
3. **Bills** -- everything non-negotiable, including minimums AND your extra debt attack
4. **Safe-to-Spend** -- what remains

The aggressive debt payment lives inside your Bills tier -- it's a non-negotiable you've chosen, not a new layer. When the debt clears, that money flows back to saving and giving. The structure doesn't change. The amounts do.

## Why Keep Giving at All?

This is the question that trips people up. If you're in debt, shouldn't every spare dollar go toward payoff?

The math says yes. The math is right as far as it goes. A dollar toward debt saves you future interest. A dollar toward giving doesn't reduce your balance.

But generosity isn't only a math equation. It's a practice -- and a biblical one. The Bible teaches that we should honor God with the first of what we earn, not the leftovers (Proverbs 3:9). That principle doesn't pause when the balance sheet is hard. And practices that stop are hard to restart.

We've seen it happen. Someone decides to pause giving until the debt is gone. Two years later, the debt is paid off, and the giving never resumes. Not because they stopped caring -- because the habit dissolved. The muscle atrophied. The $0 line became the new normal, and starting from zero again felt just as hard as it did the first time.

Maintaining even a small amount -- $10 a month, $25 a month, whatever is honest for your situation -- keeps the practice alive. It keeps giving visible in your hierarchy. It keeps the muscle working. When the debt clears and there's room to increase, you're adjusting a number, not rebuilding a habit from scratch.

If the math genuinely doesn't allow even $10 -- if every dollar is spoken for and maintaining a small giving amount would mean missing a minimum payment -- then zero is the honest number, and [the hierarchy still works at zero](/foundations/when-youre-starting-from-zero). Giving stays in position one, visible and waiting, even when the amount is nothing.

But if there is any room at all, keep giving alive. Not because you have to. Because the practice matters more than the amount, and restarting something you stopped is harder than sustaining something small.

## The Emergency Buffer: $500-$1,000

Before you go scorched-earth on debt payoff, build a small emergency buffer. Five hundred to a thousand dollars, set aside and not touched unless something genuinely unexpected happens.

This sounds counterintuitive. You owe money at high interest. Why would you save while you owe?

Because life doesn't pause for debt payoff. The car breaks down. The kid gets sick. The furnace dies in January. Without a buffer, each surprise goes on the credit card -- and you're paying down debt with one hand while creating new debt with the other. The buffer breaks that cycle.

A thousand dollars won't solve a catastrophe. But it handles the surprises that would otherwise derail your progress -- a flat tire, an urgent copay, a broken appliance. Armor for your payoff strategy.

## The Practical Reality

Here's what this looks like with real numbers. Take-home pay: $4,000 a month. Credit card debt: $8,000 at 22% interest. Student loans: $25,000 at 5% interest.

| Priority | Amount | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Giving | $25 | Baseline -- keeping the practice alive |
| Saving | $0 | Buffer built; dollars redirected to debt |
| Bills | $2,600 | Rent, utilities, minimums, plus $400 extra toward credit card |
| **Safe-to-Spend** | **$1,375** | Everything else |

That $2,600 in bills includes everything non-negotiable: rent, utilities, loan minimums, the credit card minimum, and an extra $400 attack on the high-interest balance. When the credit card is paid off, that $400 flows back -- into giving, saving, or the next debt in line.

That $400 extra toward the credit card, sustained monthly, pays off the $8,000 balance in roughly 18 months. Once it's gone, those dollars split between giving, saving, and the student loans.

This person is giving, covering all obligations, aggressively paying debt, and living on a number they can trust. That's not survival mode. That's stewardship in a hard season.

## The Emotional Journey

Debt carries more than a balance. There's shame in it -- a feeling of being behind, of being the person who wasn't disciplined enough.

Here's what we know: debt comes from circumstances as often as it comes from choices. Medical bills aren't a character flaw. Student loans were taken at eighteen by someone who couldn't have understood the weight at thirty-five. Credit card debt often started as an emergency that had nowhere else to go.

You don't owe anyone an explanation for how you got here. You owe yourself an honest plan for what happens next. The hierarchy provides that plan -- not a punishing one, but a plan that holds debt without letting debt define everything.

## Debt Is a Season, Not an Identity

The Joseph Principle -- the pattern from Genesis 41 of storing during plenty for lean seasons -- usually gets applied to saving. But it applies here too. Debt is a lean season. Think in seasons, not just months. The hierarchy is how you steward through this one with foresight instead of panic. And the most important thing to hold onto is this: seasons end.

The balance goes down. The interest shrinks. The payments finish. And when they do, the hierarchy is already in place. The giving baseline is ready to increase. The saving slot is ready to reactivate. The dollars that were going to debt become dollars that build margin.

You don't have to rebuild your financial life after debt. You've been building it the whole time. The hierarchy held the structure while the debt was being retired. When the last payment clears, you don't start over. You expand what's already working.

Debt complicates the hierarchy. But it doesn't disqualify you from stewardship -- it makes stewardship more urgent. The person who practices intentionality while carrying debt is building something stronger than the person who waits for perfect conditions to begin.

## One Step You Can Take Today

Write down your debts. All of them. Balance and interest rate for each. Don't look away from the number -- let it be real.

Then look at your current hierarchy. Where do minimum payments live? Is there room above the minimums for an extra payment, even a small one? If you cancelled a subscription or found margin somewhere, could that margin go toward the highest-interest balance?

You don't need to solve it today. You need to see it clearly. Because debt thrives in the dark -- in the vague dread of "I owe a lot" without specifics. When you write the numbers down, the dread becomes a plan. And a plan, even an imperfect one, is the beginning of the end.

You're not behind. You're in a season. And seasons change -- especially when you're building something intentional in the middle of one.
