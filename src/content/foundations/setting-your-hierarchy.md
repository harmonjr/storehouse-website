You understand the concept. Give first, save second, pay bills, spend what remains. The hierarchy makes sense when you read about it. It resonates.

And then you sit down to set it up, and the first question stops you cold: how much should I give?

You stare at the blank field. Ten percent feels like the "right" answer, but ten percent of your income is a number that makes your stomach tighten. Five percent feels like you're not trying hard enough. Zero feels like giving up before you start.

So you close the app. You'll come back to it when you've figured it out.

This is the most common place people get stuck. Not because the hierarchy is wrong, but because they're waiting to get the numbers perfect before they begin. And perfect never comes.

Here's the truth: your numbers don't have to be perfect. They just have to be intentional.

## The Enemy Is Paralysis, Not Imperfection

Decision paralysis kills more financial plans than bad math ever will. The person who spends three months deciding on the right giving percentage gives exactly zero dollars during those three months. The person who picks a number -- any honest number -- and starts today is already practicing stewardship.

Imperfect action beats perfect planning. Every time.

Your hierarchy is not a contract you sign. It's a conversation you start. The numbers you set today are a first draft, not a final answer. You'll revisit them. You'll adjust. Some months you'll increase your giving because you can. Some months you'll lower your saving because you need to. The hierarchy flexes because life does.

What matters is that you begin.

## Giving: Start Where You Are

If you're already giving regularly -- to a church, a nonprofit, a cause you care about -- write that number down. That's your starting point. Not the number you think you should give. The number you're actually giving.

If you're not giving anything right now, that's okay. Write zero. Be honest about it. The hierarchy still works at zero because the hierarchy isn't about hitting a target -- it's about the order. When giving is first, even at zero, it stays visible. You see it every week during your review. It sits there, not as an accusation but as an invitation. When you're ready, when there's room, the field is waiting.

Some guidelines if you're choosing a number:

- **Already tithing 10%?** Honor that. The hierarchy just makes it structural instead of hopeful.
- **Want to start but 10% feels impossible?** Start at 3%. Or 1%. Or $25 a month. Something is infinitely more than nothing.
- **Not sure where you'd give?** That's a separate question. Pick a number now, decide the destination later. The habit of setting money aside for generosity is the foundation. Where it goes is the next conversation.

There is no wrong number here. There is only honest and dishonest. And the most honest number is the one that reflects where you actually are, not where you think you should be.

## Saving: Something Is Everything

Saving follows giving in the hierarchy. It's second, not because it matters less than generosity, but because the order itself is the point. When saving comes before spending -- when it's a decision rather than a leftover -- it happens.

If you have no savings right now, start at 1% of your take-home pay. On a $4,000 monthly income, that's $40. You might look at that and think it's meaningless. It's not.

Forty dollars a month is $480 a year. That's a car repair. That's an urgent trip to the doctor. That's the difference between "I can handle this" and "I need to put this on a credit card." And once you're saving something -- anything -- increasing it becomes adjustment, not a leap of faith. Going from $0 to $40 is the hardest jump. Going from $40 to $80 is just a percentage change.

Some starting points:

- **No savings at all?** Start at 1%. Forty dollars on a $4,000 income.
- **Some savings but inconsistent?** Set a number you can sustain every single month, even if it's smaller than your best month.
- **Already saving 10-15%?** Write that down and protect it. The hierarchy ensures it comes out before spending, not after.

The goal isn't a specific percentage. The goal is structural consistency.

## Bills: Be Ruthlessly Honest

Bills are the third tier of the hierarchy. This is where honesty matters most, because this is where expenses hide.

True fixed bills are straightforward: rent or mortgage, utilities, insurance, car payment, minimum debt payments. These are non-negotiable. They're the same every month (or close to it). Write them down.

Then there's the gray area. The subscriptions. The memberships. The streaming services and app fees and that gym you haven't visited since March. These feel like bills because they auto-charge. But they're choices you made once and stopped making -- money leaving your account with no active consent.

Be honest about the difference between "fixed" and "forgotten." We'll talk more about this in "The Subscription Audit," but for now, as you set your hierarchy, make two lists:

1. **Truly fixed:** The bills you'd pay even in a tight month.
2. **Recurring but optional:** The charges that continue because you haven't stopped them.

Only the first list belongs in your bills tier. The second list is spending that's disguised as obligation.

## Safe-to-Spend: Your Truth

After giving, saving, and bills, what remains is your Safe-to-Spend. This is the number from "The One Number That Tells You the Truth" -- the honest answer to "what can I freely spend?"

Let's walk through an example.

**Take-home pay: $4,000/month**

| Priority | Amount | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Giving | $120 (3%) | Starting point, not a ceiling |
| Saving | $200 (5%) | Building toward an emergency fund |
| Bills | $2,100 | Rent, utilities, car, insurance, minimums |
| **Safe-to-Spend** | **$1,580** | Groceries, gas, dining, everything else |

That $1,580 is the truth. It might feel like a lot or a little depending on what you're used to seeing. But it's honest. It accounts for everything above it. What remains is genuinely, freely yours.

Consider what this person gained by setting the hierarchy. Before, their entire $1,900 after bills felt available -- but giving and saving weren't happening. Now, $320 goes to generosity and having money set aside when life surprises you. Safe-to-Spend drops by $320, but that's not a loss. That's the cost of the hierarchy -- and those are things you chose to pay for, not things that happened to you.

It might be lower than you expected. That's the truth doing its job. The number might surprise you. But a number you can trust beats a number that makes you feel better by leaving things out.

## Grace for Where You Are

Maybe you read that example and thought, "I can't afford to give anything right now." Then don't. Set giving at zero. Set saving at $20 if that's what you have. Set your bills honestly. Look at what remains.

The hierarchy still works.

It works because the hierarchy is a direction, not a destination. It puts giving first even when giving is zero -- which means when you get a raise, when the car is paid off, when things loosen up, giving is already in position. You don't have to restructure your finances to start. You just increase a number.

There is a principle in Scripture -- that God asks us to manage faithfully what we've been given, not to wait until we have more of it (Matthew 25:14-30). The servant who invested two talents wasn't judged against the servant who had five. He was judged by what he did with what he had. That is what the hierarchy is asking of you. The person who sets giving at $10 and saving at $25 and follows through is practicing stewardship more faithfully than the person who plans to give 10% and save 20% and never gets around to setting it up.

Start where you are. Not where you think you should be.

## Revisit, Don't Regret

Your hierarchy isn't a tattoo. It's a pencil sketch.

Life changes. Income shifts. Priorities evolve. The numbers you set today are right for today. Check in on them quarterly -- or whenever something significant changes. Got a raise? Maybe giving goes up. Had a baby? Your bills tier just changed.

Each time you revisit, you're not admitting failure. You're practicing stewardship -- managing well what you have right now, not locking in a plan and hoping it survives contact with reality.

The hierarchy is the constant. The numbers are the variables.

## One Step You Can Take Today

Open a blank piece of paper or a note on your phone. Write four lines:

1. **Giving:** $___
2. **Saving:** $___
3. **Bills:** $___
4. **Safe-to-Spend:** $___

Fill in the first three with honest numbers. Not aspirational numbers. Not guilt-driven numbers. Honest ones. Then subtract them from your take-home pay. Whatever remains is your Safe-to-Spend.

You don't have to get it right. You just have to get it started. The hierarchy isn't a test. It's a practice. And the only way to fail is to never begin.
