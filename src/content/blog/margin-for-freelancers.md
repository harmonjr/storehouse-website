March was $4,200. April was $1,800. May was $3,600. June was $900 and a lot of staring at the ceiling.

If you freelance, do contract work, or earn on commission, those numbers don't surprise you. What surprises you is how hard it is to find financial advice that starts from that reality instead of pretending it away.

"Enter your monthly income." Right. Which month?

The hierarchy -- Give first, Save second, Bills, then Live on what remains -- works. We believe that with everything we've built. But the hierarchy needs a stable floor to stand on, and freelance income doesn't come with one. So you build the floor yourself. That's what a buffer account is: the floor you pour before the structure goes up.

## Joseph Had the Same Problem

In Genesis 41, God showed Joseph what was coming -- seven years of abundance followed by seven years of famine. Egypt's income was about to become radically variable. Joseph's response wasn't to panic or to spend the good years living large. He stored grain during the fat years so the nation could eat during the lean ones.

Your freelance income is a smaller version of the same pattern. Some months are abundant. Some months are famine. The question isn't whether the lean months will come. It's whether you've stored anything when they do.

A buffer account is your personal granary. It doesn't require predicting which month will be lean. It just requires a system that stores automatically when things are good.

## The Mechanics

Here's how it works in practice. You need two numbers and one extra account.

**Number one: your baseline.** Look at your last six months of income. Find the lowest month. That's your baseline -- the amount you can count on even when work is slow. If your last six months were $4,200, $1,800, $3,600, $900, $2,800, and $3,100, your baseline is $900. That feels low, so let's be practical: maybe your true floor is closer to $1,800 if that $900 month was an anomaly. Use your judgment. The point is to pick a number that's realistic in a bad month, not an average that flatters you.

**Number two: your monthly need.** Add up your non-negotiables -- giving, saving targets, rent, utilities, insurance, groceries, minimum debt payments. Let's say that's $2,600.

If your baseline is lower than your monthly need, the gap is what your buffer covers. And every dollar above your baseline in a good month feeds the buffer.

**The account:** A separate savings account. Not your emergency fund. Not your checking account. A dedicated buffer that exists for one purpose -- paying yourself a stable amount each month regardless of what your clients paid you.

## A Month-by-Month Example

Say your monthly need is $2,600 and you start with $3,000 in the buffer.

**March: you earn $4,200.** You move $2,600 to checking for the hierarchy. The remaining $1,600 goes to the buffer. Buffer balance: $4,600.

**April: you earn $1,800.** That's $800 short of your monthly need. The buffer covers the gap. You still move $2,600 to checking. Buffer balance: $3,800.

**May: you earn $3,600.** After your $2,600, the extra $1,000 feeds the buffer. Buffer balance: $4,800.

**June: the $900 month.** The buffer covers $1,700. You still move $2,600 to checking. Buffer balance: $3,100.

Four months. Income swung from $4,200 to $900. Your spending? Steady at $2,600 every single month. The hierarchy never broke. Giving happened on schedule. Savings happened on schedule. Bills got paid. You didn't eat ramen in June because March was generous.

That's the buffer doing its job -- absorbing the volatility so your financial life doesn't have to.

## The Hierarchy on a Freelancer's Terms

Here's the part that trips people up: if your income varies, do your giving and saving percentages vary too?

They can. But they don't have to.

When you pay yourself a stable $2,600 from the buffer, your hierarchy runs on that number every month. Give first -- maybe that's $130 at 5%. Save second -- maybe $260 at 10%. Bills take their share. Safe-to-Spend gets the rest. Same rhythm as someone with a salary. The buffer is what creates that rhythm.

Some freelancers prefer a different approach: run the hierarchy on actual income, before the buffer split. A $4,200 month means a bigger tithe. A $900 month means a smaller one. Both approaches honor the order. The buffer method is simpler because it removes the decision each month. The actual-income method might feel more responsive to what God is providing in real time.

Either way, giving doesn't wait for a good month. Even variable income can put giving first. The buffer just makes it less stressful to do so.

## How Much Buffer Is Enough?

Two to three months of your monthly need is a solid target. If your monthly need is $2,600, aim for $5,200 to $7,800 in the buffer before you raise your "salary" or redirect surplus elsewhere.

If you're just starting, don't let the target freeze you. A buffer with $500 in it is better than no buffer at all. That $500 might cover a week of gap between a slow month and the next payment landing. Start where you are.

And the buffer is not your emergency fund. The emergency fund handles the unexpected -- the car that breaks, the medical bill. The buffer handles the expected -- the reality that freelance income fluctuates. They're different tools for different problems. Build both, but keep them separate so you always know what each one is for.

## When the Buffer Gets Fat

Good problem to have. If your buffer grows past three months of your monthly need, you have a decision to make.

You could raise your monthly "salary" -- move $2,800 to checking instead of $2,600. More margin in your Safe-to-Spend, more room in your giving and saving. Just make sure the raise is sustainable; your buffer should stay above two months even after the adjustment.

You could redirect surplus to longer-term goals. Extra toward debt payoff. A bigger emergency fund. An investment account. The buffer doesn't need to grow forever -- it needs to stay big enough to do its job.

You could be more generous. A fat buffer month might be exactly the kind of abundance where giving beyond your baseline percentage feels right. Joseph stored grain to sustain a nation, not to hoard it. The surplus serves its purpose when it flows to where it's needed.

## The Freelancer's Guilt

There's a specific kind of guilt that comes with variable income. Good months feel like you should be saving all of it because the bad month is always coming. Bad months feel like evidence that this whole freelancing thing isn't working. The cycle creates a financial anxiety that has nothing to do with your actual numbers and everything to do with the unpredictability.

The buffer breaks that cycle. When you know that June's $900 month is covered, you stop dreading it. When you know that March's $4,200 is being stored, not squandered, you stop feeling guilty about it. The buffer gives you permission to earn unevenly and live steadily.

That's stewardship in a freelancer's context. Not pretending your income is stable. Not wishing it were different. Managing faithfully what actually shows up, month by month, with a system that smooths the edges.

## One Step You Can Take Today

Open a savings account. Call it "Buffer" or "Income Smoothing" or "The Granary" -- whatever reminds you what it's for. Set it up at the same bank as your checking so transfers are instant.

Next time income hits your account, move your monthly need to checking and leave the rest in the buffer. That's it. You don't need to calculate six months of trailing averages or build a spreadsheet. Move what you need, store what you don't. Repeat.

The months will still swing. Your spending doesn't have to swing with them.
