If you've ever tried to use a traditional budgeting app with irregular income, you know the frustration. "Enter your monthly income," it says. As if you have any idea what next month will bring.

Freelancers, contractors, and commission earners live in a different financial reality. Here's how to build real margin when your income won't sit still.

## The Baseline Strategy

The key is separating your *income* from your *spending*. They don't have to match month-to-month — and trying to make them match is what drives people crazy.

Instead, establish a baseline: the minimum amount you can expect in a bad month. This becomes your "spending salary." Everything above the baseline goes into a buffer account.

## Building Your Buffer

The buffer is your secret weapon. It sits between your income (variable) and your spending (stable), smoothing out the peaks and valleys.

Here's how it works:
- Good month? Excess goes to the buffer.
- Slow month? Buffer tops you up to baseline.
- Buffer getting fat? Time to increase your spending salary or allocate to goals.

## The Storehouse Approach

Storehouse is built for irregular income from the ground up. Your Safe-to-Spend number adapts to what's actually in your accounts, not what you predicted would be there.

When a big payment lands, you don't suddenly feel rich and overspend. When payments are slow, you don't panic — you know exactly what's available.

## Three Rules for Variable Income

1. **Never spend windfalls immediately.** Let big payments sit for at least a pay period before adjusting your lifestyle.

2. **Build buffer before boosting lifestyle.** Aim for 2-3 months of baseline spending in your buffer before increasing your "salary."

3. **Track trailing averages, not monthly snapshots.** What's your average income over the last 6 months? That's more useful than any single month.

## The Mindset Shift

Most financial advice assumes stability: same paycheck, same day, every two weeks. That's not your reality — and pretending it is only creates stress.

Embrace the variability. Build systems that work with irregular income, not against it. And stop feeling like you're doing money wrong just because your situation doesn't fit the standard template.

You're not broken. Traditional budgeting is just not built for you.
