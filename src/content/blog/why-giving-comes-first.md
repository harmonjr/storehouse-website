Most financial advice starts with "pay yourself first." Build your emergency fund. Max out your 401k. Then, if there's anything left, maybe consider giving something away.

Storehouse takes a different approach. We believe giving should come *first* — not as an afterthought, not as a guilt-driven obligation, but as the foundation of a healthy relationship with money.

## It's Not About the Amount

When we say "give first," we're not talking about a specific percentage or dollar amount. We're talking about a posture — a way of holding money loosely instead of with a white-knuckle grip.

The person who gives $50 from their paycheck with joy has something the person hoarding millions often lacks: freedom from money's control.

## Why This Actually Works

Here's the surprising part: people who prioritize generosity often end up with *more* margin, not less. Not because of some prosperity gospel magic, but because generosity changes how you see everything else.

When you give first, you:
- Break the scarcity mindset that drives overspending
- Make intentional choices about what remains
- Build contentment as a habit, not a destination

## The Storehouse Approach

In Storehouse, your giving allocation isn't buried in a "miscellaneous" category. It's right at the top, part of your core priorities. You see it every time you check your Safe-to-Spend number.

Because giving isn't about what's left over. It's about who you want to become.
