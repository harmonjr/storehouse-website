You've tried budgeting apps. You've made spreadsheets. You've categorized every latte and felt guilty about every "unnecessary" purchase. And yet, somehow, you still don't know if it's okay to buy that thing you're looking at right now.

What if there was a simpler way?

## One Number to Rule Them All

The Safe-to-Spend method works like this: instead of tracking 47 categories, you track one number. It tells you exactly what you can spend freely — after your bills, savings, and giving are already handled.

That's it. No guilt. No guessing. No mental math at the register.

## How It's Different

Traditional budgeting asks: "How much did I spend on groceries vs. dining out vs. coffee vs. entertainment?"

Safe-to-Spend asks: "Is my number above zero?"

If yes, buy the coffee. Enjoy the dinner out. Stop second-guessing every purchase.

If no, wait until it is.

## The Math Behind It

Here's the formula:

**Safe-to-Spend = Available Cash - Upcoming Bills - Priority Allocations**

Your "priority allocations" are the things that matter most: giving, saving for goals, building margin. These get set aside first, automatically.

What remains is yours to spend however you want. Groceries and restaurants? Same bucket. Coffee and entertainment? Same bucket. The categories don't matter anymore.

## Why It Works

Traditional budgets fail because they require constant discipline in 47 different areas. Safe-to-Spend requires discipline in *one* decision: setting your priorities at the start.

After that, spending becomes simple. The hard work is already done.

## Getting Started

1. List your bills (the non-negotiables)
2. Decide your priorities (giving, saving, margin)
3. Calculate what's left
4. Live on that number

No apps required — though Storehouse makes it automatic.
