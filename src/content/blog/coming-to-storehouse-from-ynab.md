You know what zero-based budgeting is. You've given every dollar a job. You've rolled with the punches, aged your money, and reconciled your accounts more times than you can count. YNAB taught you to pay attention to your money, and that's worth something real.

But somewhere along the way, paying attention started to feel like a second job.

Maybe it was the Tuesday night you spent moving money between categories because the grocery bill was $30 over. Maybe it was the monthly ritual of reconciling eight accounts and wondering why you're spending your evening doing finance administration instead of reading a book. Maybe you kept up for two years and then took a week off and the backlog felt so heavy you never went back.

If you're here, you've probably already decided that YNAB isn't working for you anymore. This isn't about convincing you to leave. It's about showing you what's different if you do.

## What You Already Know

YNAB taught you something most people never learn: your money needs a plan. That instinct doesn't go away when you switch tools. You're not starting over. You're carrying forward the most important thing YNAB gave you -- the habit of being intentional.

Storehouse builds on that habit. It just structures it differently.

## The Philosophical Difference

YNAB asks: *What job should every dollar do?*

Storehouse asks: *What matters most, and have I taken care of it?*

Both questions come from the same place -- intentionality. Both reject autopilot spending. But they lead to very different daily experiences.

Zero-based budgeting distributes your attention across every category, every dollar, every transaction. The system works when you maintain it. It collapses when you don't -- and the recovery work (re-categorizing weeks of transactions, moving money between overspent categories, rebuilding category balances) is often what pushes people away.

Storehouse concentrates your attention into one decision: set your hierarchy. Give first. Save second. Pay your bills. Spend what remains. Four tiers instead of forty-seven categories. One number -- Safe-to-Spend -- instead of a dashboard full of progress bars.

The control shifts from micro-management to priority-setting. You make a few important decisions at the start, and then you live within what's left.

## How the Import Actually Works

Storehouse has a full YNAB import. Export your data from YNAB, bring it into Storehouse, and your transaction history comes with you.

The part that matters most is category mapping. YNAB organizes your money into groups and categories -- "Immediate Obligations" with sub-categories like "Rent," "Electric," "Groceries." Storehouse organizes money into four hierarchy tiers: Give, Save, Bills, Live.

The import handles this automatically. Storehouse includes 38 sub-category defaults that map your YNAB categories to the right tier. Your "Groceries" category maps to Live. Your "Rent" maps to Bills. Your "Tithe" maps to Give. There are also 28 group-level defaults for broader mapping -- so if you have a YNAB group called "Immediate Obligations," the import knows where those sub-categories belong even if a specific sub-category name isn't in the defaults.

You can customize any mapping during the import. If you've renamed your YNAB categories or organized them in a way that doesn't match the defaults, you adjust the mapping before importing. Nothing happens to your data without your say-so.

What transfers: your transaction history, your payees, your amounts, your dates.

What doesn't transfer: your category balances, your goals, your age-of-money calculation, your budgeted amounts. Those concepts don't have equivalents in Storehouse because Storehouse doesn't work that way.

## What You'll Lose

Honesty matters here. If you switch, some things go away, and you should know what they are before you decide.

**Envelope budgeting.** YNAB's core metaphor -- putting dollars into digital envelopes and spending from those envelopes -- doesn't exist in Storehouse. There are no category balances to track or envelopes to fill. If the envelope system is what keeps you on track, that's a significant change.

**Category goals.** YNAB lets you set targets for individual categories -- save $500 for car insurance by June, budget $400 for groceries each month. Storehouse doesn't have per-category goals. The hierarchy is the goal structure: give this much, save this much, cover your bills, live on what remains.

**Age of money.** That metric tracking how old your dollars are before you spend them -- it's a YNAB-specific concept with no equivalent here.

**Granular spending reports by category.** YNAB shows you exactly how much went to groceries versus dining out versus household supplies. Storehouse shows you how much you gave, saved, spent on bills, and spent on everything else. The detail within "everything else" isn't broken out by category.

If those features were the reason YNAB worked for you, Storehouse might not be the right move. These aren't things we plan to add. They represent a different philosophy, and removing them is intentional.

## What You'll Gain

**One number instead of forty-seven categories.** Safe-to-Spend tells you what you can freely spend after giving, saving, and bills are handled. You don't check whether dinner comes from the dining budget or the entertainment budget. You check one number. If it's above zero, you're good.

**The hierarchy.** Giving comes first, not last. In YNAB, giving is a category that competes with every other category for dollars. In Storehouse, it's the first tier. It happens before saving, before bills, before discretionary spending. If generosity matters to you, the structure protects it instead of leaving it to willpower.

**A weekly rhythm instead of daily categorization.** YNAB works best when you categorize transactions as they happen -- daily engagement keeps the budget accurate. Storehouse works on a weekly review cycle. Check in once a week, review your Safe-to-Spend, make adjustments if needed. The rest of the week, you live on one number.

**Permission to stop tracking every dollar.** This is the hardest shift for YNAB users. You've trained yourself to account for every transaction. Storehouse asks you to account for your priorities and then stop worrying about the rest. Groceries and dining out and coffee all come from the same pool. The pool is what matters, not the breakdown within it.

## The Mindset Shift

This is the part that takes longer than the data import.

YNAB trains you to think in categories. Every dollar has a job. Every purchase has a label. You develop a detailed mental map of where money is and where it's going. That awareness is valuable -- it's what broke most YNAB users out of the paycheck-to-paycheck cycle in the first place.

Storehouse trains you to think in priorities. What matters most? Is it handled? Then spend what remains without guilt.

The shift feels like losing control at first. You've spent months or years tracking every category, and now someone is asking you to stop. The instinct is to resist -- to add categories, to break down spending, to keep the granular view.

Give it a month. What most YNAB switchers discover is that the control they were maintaining wasn't serving them anymore. It was serving the system. The categories were accurate, but the experience was exhausting. When you replace forty-seven decisions with one number, the relief is physical. You can feel your shoulders drop.

What if the problem wasn't your discipline? It was the tool asking too much of it.

## A Practical Transition

If you're ready to try it, here's what the move looks like:

1. **Export your YNAB data.** YNAB lets you export your budget and transactions as files.
2. **Import into Storehouse.** The import walks you through category mapping. Review the defaults, adjust anything that doesn't fit, and confirm.
3. **Set your hierarchy.** Decide your giving target, your saving target, and confirm your bills. Storehouse calculates your Safe-to-Spend from there.
4. **Give yourself two weeks.** The first week will feel strange. You'll want to check categories that don't exist. You'll wonder where the dining budget went. By the second week, you'll start checking one number instead -- and the simplicity will start to click.
5. **Do a weekly review.** Once a week, look at your Safe-to-Spend, review any transactions that need attention, and confirm your priorities are on track. That's the whole ritual.

You don't have to cancel YNAB on day one. Run them side by side for a month if you want. Some people need to see the hierarchy hold up under real spending before they trust it.

## Not Better. Different.

YNAB is a well-built tool that has helped millions of people take control of their finances. If it's working for you, keep using it. Seriously. A working system you maintain beats a theoretically better system you abandon.

But if you've been maintaining it out of obligation more than conviction -- if the categories have become a chore, if the reconciliation feels like homework, if you're avoiding the app more than opening it -- that's not a failure of discipline. It might be a mismatch between the tool's demands and your capacity.

Storehouse doesn't ask less of you because it cares less about your money. It asks less of you in the details so you can focus more on the priorities. Give first. Save second. Spend what remains. One number. One weekly check-in. That's the whole system.

You already know how to be intentional with money. YNAB taught you that. Now you get to keep the intention and let go of the overhead.
