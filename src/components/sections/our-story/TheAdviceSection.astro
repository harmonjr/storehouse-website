        He showed me the real cost difference between a $250,000 mortgage and a $127,000 one — the monthly payments, the interest over 30 years, and what that extra money could become if I invested it instead. The numbers were staggering. The difference wasn't just $123,000 — it was decades of compounding.

        I bought the modest starter home. And for the first time, I had room to breathe.
