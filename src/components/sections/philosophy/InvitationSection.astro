          You don't have to believe everything on this page to use Storehouse.
        </p>

        <p>
          On the surface, Storehouse gives you one number - what's safe to spend. That alone can bring clarity and peace.
        </p>

        <p>
          But if you want to go deeper, there's a philosophy here. A way of thinking about margin, generosity, and trust that can transform your relationship with money.
