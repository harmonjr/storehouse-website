          Most financial advice says "pay yourself first." Put money into savings before you spend it. Build your wealth. Prioritize your future.
        </p>

        <p>
          It's not bad advice. But it's not our advice.

          The order reveals your priorities.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Bible describes a principle called "firstfruits" (Proverbs 3:9) -- give from the first of what you receive, not from what's left over. It's about generosity as a posture, giving back to God before you do anything else.
        </p>

        <p>
          When giving comes first, everything else falls into perspective. Saving becomes provision, not hoarding. Spending becomes enjoyment, not guilt.
        </p>

        <p>
          Storehouse is built around this order. Your giving priorities sit at the top. Your Safe to Spend number reflects what's left after generosity is handled.
