          <h3>Not Financial Advice</h3>
          <p>
            Storehouse is an information and awareness tool only. Nothing in our service
            constitutes financial, investment, tax, or legal advice. The "safe to spend"

            general assumptions. They may not account for your complete financial situation.
          </p>
          <p>
            You should consult qualified professionals for financial, investment, tax,
            or legal advice specific to your circumstances.
