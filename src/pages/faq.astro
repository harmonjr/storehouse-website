You don't need to share that belief to benefit from the approach, but we're not going to pretend the foundation is something else.

              <p>Margin is the breathing room between your income and your spending. Storehouse tracks your margin health by showing how many months of expenses you have saved. The Joseph Principle &mdash; store during plenty so you're ready for lean seasons &mdash; is built into how margin works. The goal is to build margin during good seasons so you can weather whatever comes next without stress.</p>

              <p>The Joseph Principle comes from Genesis 41, where God revealed to Joseph that seven years of abundance would be followed by seven years of famine. Joseph's response &mdash; store during plenty so you can survive the lean &mdash; is the pattern Storehouse is built on. In Storehouse, this means building margin during seasons of abundance so you're prepared for whatever comes next &mdash; a job loss, medical expenses, economic shifts, or simply a slow month. The principle applies to anyone who wants financial breathing room, and it's especially powerful for those with variable income.</p>

              <p>Yes &mdash; Storehouse was designed with variable income in mind. Traditional budgets assume steady paychecks, which doesn't work for commission salespeople, freelancers, or business owners.

              <p>Most financial advice says "pay yourself first" -- save before you spend. That's not wrong. But we believe the order matters. When giving comes from leftovers, it feels like sacrifice. When giving comes first, it becomes foundation. It's a statement of priorities and an act of trust in God. Storehouse puts giving first, then saving, then bills -- and shows you what's left. This order reflects values, not just math.</p>

              <p>That's okay. Storehouse doesn't require you to give anything. You set your own priorities. If giving isn't possible right now, set it to zero and focus on building margin. The app works either way. The "give first" philosophy is an invitation, not a requirement.</p>

In the Bible, the storehouse was where provision was kept for the community, especially for times of need. Storehouse the app carries that same idea: a place to manage your resources with wisdom and generosity.</p>

              <p>Storehouse was created by JR, a real estate professional with 20+ years of experience helping people make their biggest financial decision -- buying a home. The same philosophy of margin (don't buy the most house you can afford) applies to daily finances: don't spend everything you make. Leave room to breathe.</p>
