        <section id="how-we-protect" class="scroll-mt-24 mt-12">
          <h2>4. How We Protect Your Information</h2>
          <p>
            We implement industry-standard security measures to protect your information:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>All data is encrypted in transit using TLS 1.2 or higher</li>
            <li>Sensitive data is encrypted at rest using AES-256 encryption</li>
            <li>Bank credentials are never stored by Storehouse; all connections go through Plaid</li>
            <li>We use secure, SOC 2 compliant infrastructure providers</li>
            <li>Regular security audits and vulnerability assessments</li>
            <li>Access to user data is strictly limited to authorized personnel</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            While we strive to protect your information, no method of transmission or
            storage is 100% secure. We cannot guarantee absolute security but are
            committed to maintaining the highest practical standards.

            thousands of financial services. For more information, see
            <a href="https://plaid.com/legal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">

          </p>

          <h3>Analytics</h3>
          <p>
            We may use third-party analytics services to understand how users interact
            with Storehouse. These services may collect anonymized usage data to help
            us improve our product.
          </p>

          <h3>Infrastructure Providers</h3>

            We use cloud infrastructure providers to host our service. These providers
