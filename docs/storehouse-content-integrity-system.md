# Storehouse: Content Integrity System

## The Core Filter

Every piece of content must serve one question:

**Does this help someone become a better steward of what God has given them?**

Biblical stewardship is the heart of Storehouse -- the conviction that what we have isn't ours to consume but ours to manage faithfully for God. Give first. Save second. Spend what remains. That order isn't a suggestion; it's the architecture of a life that builds margin instead of burning through it.

If content doesn't help users understand, practice, or sustain this hierarchy, it doesn't belong on this platform.

---

## The Four Pillars

All content must serve at least one of these four applications:

### 1. Margin
**Question:** Does this help users build and protect financial breathing room?

Content that serves Margin:
- Encourages living below your means -- not as deprivation but as freedom
- Provides specific frameworks (Safe-to-Spend as the daily guardrail)
- Addresses the forces that erode margin (lifestyle creep, subscription accumulation, keeping up)
- Celebrates what margin makes possible (generosity, peace, choices, sleep)
- Connects margin to the bigger picture: retirement readiness, emergency resilience, relational health

**The principle:** Margin isn't what's left over. It's what you protect on purpose.

### 2. Clarity
**Question:** Does this help users see where their money actually goes?

Content that serves Clarity:
- Reveals the gap between what people think they spend and what they actually spend
- Makes the invisible visible (subscription creep, true cost of habits, the difference between gross and take-home)
- Explains how Safe-to-Spend works and why it's trustworthy
- Shows the math behind the hierarchy -- what giving first and saving second actually costs (and what it creates)

**The principle:** People can't steward what they can't see.

### 3. Order
**Question:** Does this help users put first things first?

Content that serves Order:
- Reinforces the biblical money hierarchy: Give, Save, Bills, Live
- Explains why the order matters (not legalism, but freedom)
- Challenges the cultural default: spend first, save if there's extra, give if you feel generous
- Shows what happens when the hierarchy is followed -- and what happens when it isn't
- Makes the case for intentionality over autopilot

**The principle:** The order you assign your dollars reveals the order you assign your values.

### 4. Peace
**Question:** Does this reduce financial anxiety instead of increasing it?

Content that serves Peace:
- Helps couples get on the same page ("Can we afford this?" has one answer: check Safe-to-Spend)
- Removes guilt and shame from the money conversation
- Celebrates progress over perfection
- Acknowledges that stewardship is a practice, not a destination
- Offers hope to people who are behind, not just people who are ahead

**The principle:** Financial peace isn't the absence of problems. It's the presence of a plan.

## The Five Filter Questions

Before publishing any content, ask:

1. **Does this serve stewardship?**
   If no -- don't publish.

2. **Which pillar does this serve?**
   Must clearly serve Clarity, Order, Margin, or Peace (can serve multiple).

3. **Does this make the reader feel equipped and hopeful -- or guilty and overwhelmed?**
   We empower. We never shame. If content makes someone feel worse about their finances without showing a way forward, it fails.

4. **Would Joseph recognize this wisdom?**
   God revealed to Joseph (Genesis 41) that abundance would be followed by famine. Joseph's response -- store with foresight, not hoard with fear -- is the pattern for biblical stewardship. The Joseph Principle isn't limited to income fluctuations; it's about building margin for whatever life brings -- job loss, medical bills, economic shifts, or simply a season that costs more than expected. Would he recognize this content as faithful preparation for uncertainty, not anxious control?

5. **Am I being honest -- or performative?**
   Honest means acknowledging that stewardship is hard, that we fail, and that the hierarchy is an aspiration we grow into. Performative means pretending we've arrived.

## Voice Guidelines

### Author Naming
- The author/builder is referred to as **JR** only
- Never "JR Harmon," never "Randy" in editorial content
- Exception: the testimonial card uses "Randy and Karen" (personal, not editorial)

### We Are:
- **Warm, not clinical** -- This is a kitchen-table conversation about money, not a financial seminar.
- **Honest about struggle** -- We've been behind on savings. We've had the "money fight" with our spouse. We're building this because we need it too.
- **Encouraging, not punishing** -- YNAB felt like a disappointed parent. Storehouse feels like a friend who believes you can do this.
- **Margin-first, generosity-discovered** -- We lead with margin because it's the universal need. Our audience is margin-seekers first -- people who need breathing room regardless of background. Giving is structurally prominent (first in the hierarchy) but it's a discovery moment, not a sales pitch. The journey is: stressed, margin, freedom, generosity.
- **Biblically grounded, not preachy** -- We name the Bible as our source and cite Scripture where it strengthens the point. Faith is stated directly ("Built on biblical financial principles") as the source of the conviction -- not hidden in the footer, not turned into a sermon. The goal is honesty about where this comes from, not a lecture.
- **Simple, not simplistic** -- One number (Safe-to-Spend) is simple. Ignoring retirement is simplistic. We know the difference.
- **Attributive, not vague** -- When a principle comes from the Bible, say so. "The Bible teaches..." and "God's wisdom" are better than "ancient wisdom" or "faith traditions." Give credit where it's due.

### We Are Not:
- Prosperity gospel ("God wants you to be rich")
- Poverty gospel ("Money is evil, wanting nice things is sin")
- Dave Ramsey aggressive ("You're broke because you're stupid")
- Guilt-driven ("You should be giving more")
- Exclusionary ("This is only for Christians")
- Legalistic ("10% tithe is mandatory or you're failing God")

### Tone Spectrum:

| Context | Tone |
|---------|------|
| Dashboard UI | Calm, clear, minimal -- the number speaks |
| Onboarding | Warm, inviting, "you're in the right place" |
| Educational content | Conversational, honest, like explaining to a friend |
| Error states | Gentle, never accusatory ("Let's fix that" not "You did it wrong") |
| Marketing/website | Confident but humble, "we built this because we needed it" |
| Subscription alerts | Matter-of-fact, no alarm -- "Here's what we noticed" |

### Signature Phrases:
- "Give first. Save second. Spend what remains."
- "Store today. Thrive tomorrow."
- "Safe-to-Spend: the one number that tells you the truth."
- "Stewardship over ownership."
- "The hierarchy isn't punishment. It's freedom."
- "Finally, breathing room."
- "Built on biblical financial principles. Designed for anyone who wants breathing room."
- "Think in seasons, not just months."
- "Categories are the rearview mirror, not the steering wheel."
- "You don't need another budget. You need clarity."

### Humor:
- Light, self-deprecating, relatable
- "We built the subscription detector because we found $847/year in services we forgot we had"
- Never mocking people who are struggling
- Clean, family-friendly

## Truth Extraction

As content is created, certain statements emerge as **core truths** -- principles that stand alone and can be referenced across the platform.

### When writing, watch for statements that:
- Could be quoted independently
- Capture a key insight in memorable language
- Challenge the cultural default around money
- Would make someone pause and reconsider

### Founding truths:
- "The order you assign your dollars reveals the order you assign your values."
- "Safe-to-Spend isn't what's left over. It's what remains after you've taken care of what matters most."
- "Most people spend first, save what's left, and give if there's extra. Flip the order and everything changes."
- "You can't steward what you can't see."
- "The app doesn't manage your money. You do. The app just makes sure you can see clearly."

### Process:
1. After drafting, identify candidate truths
2. Check if truth already exists (avoid duplicates)
3. If new and strong, add to the truths database with source
4. In future content, reference existing truths where relevant

## Content Types and Standards

### App UI Microcopy
- Maximum clarity, minimum words
- Every label should pass the "would my spouse understand this instantly?" test
- No financial jargon (no "amortization," "allocation," "disbursement")
- Use the hierarchy language: Give, Save, Bills, Live (not "categories" or "envelopes")
- Storehouse auto-categorizes spending for awareness -- showing users where their money went -- but never sets category budgets or limits
- Categories are the rearview mirror, not the steering wheel: say "no category budgets" (not "no category tracking" -- we DO track categories)
- One number (Safe-to-Spend) determines what you can spend, not 47 little buckets

### Website / Landing Page
- **Hero formula:** "Finally, breathing room." (headline) + "Built on biblical financial principles. Designed for anyone who wants breathing room." (subhead)
- **Problem section leads with clarity:** "You don't need another budget. You need clarity."
- The front door is margin and breathing room -- giving is what margin makes possible, discovered rather than pitched
- The emotional journey: stressed, clarity, margin, freedom, generosity
- Show the hierarchy visually -- it's the product's strongest differentiator, and giving in the first position is the discovery moment
- The Joseph Principle is a key differentiator alongside Safe-to-Spend and the hierarchy
- Social proof from real usage, not hypothetical scenarios
- Be direct about the biblical foundation ("Built on biblical financial principles") while making clear that anyone can benefit from the approach

### Educational / Blog Content
- 800-1,500 words (shorter than Candid Agent -- Storehouse readers want practical, not philosophical)
- One clear takeaway per piece
- Must serve at least one pillar
- Include at least one actionable step the reader can take today
- End with encouragement, not a call to action

### Onboarding / Help Content
- Progressive disclosure: show what's needed now, let users discover the rest
- Celebrate first actions ("You just set your giving target. That's the hardest part.")
- Anticipate confusion: Safe-to-Spend will seem wrong the first time. Explain why it's trustworthy.
- Never assume financial literacy

---

## Financial Accuracy

Credibility is existential for a finance app. If users ever think "that number is wrong," they leave.

### The Trust Architecture
- Safe-to-Spend must always show its work (last import date, unreviewed count, calculation breakdown)
- Never display a number without context for how fresh it is
- Orange warnings for stale data -- never blame the user, just show the gap
- "As of" framing shifts responsibility from "the app is wrong" to "we need fresh data"

### What to Flag in Content
- **Overpromising savings amounts** -- Don't say "save $500/month" without showing the math from a realistic scenario
- **Implying the app does the work** -- The user is the steward. The app provides visibility. Always frame it this way.
- **Generic percentage advice** -- "Save 20% of your income" without acknowledging that some families are starting from 0% and 5% would be a victory
- **Tax implications stated as fact** -- Tithing may or may not be tax-deductible depending on the recipient. Don't give tax advice.

### The Principle
Be accurate, be humble about what the app can and can't do, and never let marketing outpace reality.

## Feature Accuracy

When describing Storehouse features in any content, use the correct framing:

| Feature | Correct Description | NOT This |
|---------|-------------------|----------|
| Joseph Principle | Margin building for life's uncertainty | Income smoothing (too narrow) |
| Categories | Auto-categorize for awareness | Category budgets / limits / tracking |
| Giving | Giving tracker with annual totals | Tax export tool |
| Data import | Weekly balance updates through manual import | Auto-connect / bank sync |
| Safe-to-Spend | One number after priorities are handled | Budget / spending limit |

The goal is precision. Each feature does one thing well -- describe that thing, not an adjacent thing the user might assume.

---

## Red Lines (Never Publish)

- Content that shames people for their financial situation
- Prosperity gospel messaging ("Give more and God will bless you with more")
- Legalistic messaging ("You must tithe 10% or you're sinning")
- Comparisons to other apps by name that feel like attacks (we can differentiate without diminishing)
- Content that implies Storehouse replaces professional financial advice
- Fear-based messaging ("You'll never retire" / "You're running out of time")
- Content that excludes non-Christians from the value proposition (the hierarchy works for anyone; we're transparent about the biblical source without requiring readers to share the belief)

---

## The Relationship to Margin

Storehouse and The Candid Agent share a root philosophy: **margin is the foundation of a life well-lived.**

- The Candid Agent applies margin to the **housing decision** -- the biggest single commitment
- Storehouse applies margin to **everyday financial stewardship** -- the ongoing practice

They are complementary. A reader of The Candid Agent who bought the right house still needs to steward their daily finances. A Storehouse user building margin might eventually use The Candid Agent's principles when buying a home.

**The shared conviction:** Living below your means isn't deprivation. It's the most generous, peaceful, resilient way to live. The order of your dollars reflects the order of your values.

---

## The Joseph Principle

In Genesis 41, God revealed to Joseph that seven years of abundance would be followed by seven years of famine. Joseph's response -- store during plenty so you can survive the lean -- became the model for faithful stewardship. The wisdom was God's; Joseph was the faithful executor.

The Joseph Principle is Storehouse's name for this pattern, and it's broader than any single financial scenario. It's about building margin for life's uncertainty -- not just income fluctuations. It applies to:

- A job loss that comes without warning
- Medical expenses that don't wait for permission
- A car repair on the worst possible Tuesday
- An economic downturn that affects everyone
- And yes, income that varies month to month

Variable income is one application of the Joseph Principle, not the definition. The principle is woven into how Storehouse works from the ground up.

### Writing about the Joseph Principle:
- Use "seasons" language: "plenty seasons / lean seasons" -- not months
- Credit God as the source of the wisdom, not just Joseph as the executor
- The key phrase: **"Think in seasons, not just months."**
- Frame it as preparation born from faith, not anxiety born from fear
- Keep the scope broad: margin for whatever life brings, not a niche feature for freelancers

## The Ultimate Test

Before publishing, ask:

> "If someone who is anxious about money read only this, would they feel more equipped and more hopeful -- not more guilty or more overwhelmed?"

If yes -- publish.
If no -- revise or discard.

---

## Quarterly Audit

Every three months, review published content:

1. **Pillar balance:** Are we serving all four pillars, or leaning too heavily on one?
2. **Truth consistency:** Do newer pieces align with established truths?
3. **Voice drift:** Are we staying warm and encouraging, or getting preachy or clinical?
4. **Shame check:** Has any content crept toward guilt-driven messaging?
5. **Accessibility:** Is the biblical foundation clear while remaining welcoming to non-Christians?
6. **Gaps:** What aspects of stewardship haven't we addressed?

---

## Summary

**One core belief:** Stewardship -- managing well what you've been given -- is the path to margin, peace, and generosity.

**Four pillars:** Margin, Clarity, Order, Peace.

**Five filter questions:** Does it serve stewardship? Which pillar? Equipped and hopeful? Would Joseph recognize this as faithful preparation? Honest or performative?

**One ultimate test:** Would an anxious person feel more equipped and more hopeful?

Everything else flows from this.
