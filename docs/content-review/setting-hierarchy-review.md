## Review Summary

This is a well-crafted practical companion to the Give First article. The voice is warm, the guilt radar is clean, and the on-ramps for every income level are genuinely inviting. Two issues require revision: the article describes Safe-to-Spend as having "Groceries, gas, dining, everything else" (line 93) without noting that Storehouse auto-categorizes these for awareness -- this risks implying the app ignores where discretionary money goes. Additionally, line 97 uses the phrase "having money set aside when life surprises you" which is an opportunity to name the Joseph Principle by name and plant the broader "seasons" vocabulary. One craft issue: the closing section wraps too neatly with a bow.

## Filter Questions

| # | Question | Result |
|---|----------|--------|
| 1 | Does this serve stewardship? | PASS -- The entire article teaches readers how to set giving, saving, and bill targets as an act of stewardship. Line 109 cites the parable of the talents (Matthew 25) to ground stewardship in Scripture. |
| 2 | Which pillar does this serve? | PASS -- Order (primary), with strong secondary service to Clarity (the Safe-to-Spend walkthrough) and Peace (grace for starting at zero). |
| 3 | Does this make the reader feel equipped and hopeful -- or guilty and overwhelmed? | PASS -- Lines 39-47 give explicit permission to start at zero. Lines 101-111 ("Grace for Where You Are") are the strongest guilt-prevention section across all three articles. |
| 4 | Would Joseph recognize this wisdom? | PASS -- The article reflects faithful stewardship of what you have now. However, it does not mention the Joseph Principle by name -- see Change 2. |
| 5 | Am I being honest -- or performative? | PASS -- "Your hierarchy is not a contract you sign. It's a conversation you start." (line 31) and "The numbers you set today are a first draft, not a final answer" signal humility and process over perfection. |

## Proposed Changes

### Change 1: Clarify what Safe-to-Spend covers -- categories are the rearview mirror

**Why:** Feature Accuracy / CIS Categories guidance. The example table (line 93) labels Safe-to-Spend as "Groceries, gas, dining, everything else." This is technically correct but risks implying that Storehouse does not track where this money goes. The updated CIS says: "Storehouse auto-categorizes spending for awareness" and "Categories are the rearview mirror, not the steering wheel." This is an opportunity to plant that distinction.

> **Current (lines 93-95):**
> | **Safe-to-Spend** | **$1,580** | Groceries, gas, dining, everything else |
>
> That $1,580 is the truth. It might feel like a lot or a little depending on what you're used to seeing. But it's honest. It accounts for everything above it. What remains is genuinely, freely yours.

> **Proposed:**
> | **Safe-to-Spend** | **$1,580** | Everything else -- groceries, gas, dining, all of it |
>
> That $1,580 is the truth. It might feel like a lot or a little depending on what you're used to seeing. But it's honest. It accounts for everything above it. What remains is genuinely, freely yours to spend. Storehouse still shows you where it goes -- categories are the rearview mirror, showing you patterns after the fact -- but no category budgets, no guilt about which bucket you pull from. One number. That's the guardrail.

### Change 2: Name the Joseph Principle where "life surprises you" appears

**Why:** Joseph Principle alignment. Line 97 says "having money set aside when life surprises you" -- this is exactly what the Joseph Principle means in the updated CIS ("margin for life's uncertainty"). Naming it here plants the concept early for readers who will encounter it in other articles, and it reinforces the broader definition (not limited to variable income).

> **Current (line 97):**
> Now, $320 goes to generosity and having money set aside when life surprises you.

> **Proposed:**
> Now, $320 goes to generosity and margin for when life surprises you -- what Storehouse calls the Joseph Principle, after the Genesis story of storing during plenty so you're ready for lean seasons.

### Change 3: Tighten the closing paragraph -- too neat

**Why:** AI Tells -- Neat Conclusion. Lines 133-134 wrap the article with a bow: "You don't have to get it right. You just have to get it started. The hierarchy isn't a test. It's a practice. And the only way to fail is to never begin." This collects three distinct sentiments (imperfection is okay, it's a practice, failure is inaction) into one tidy paragraph. Each of these ideas has already been stated earlier in the article ("imperfect action beats perfect planning" at line 29, "not a final answer" at line 31, "what matters is that you begin" at line 33). The repetition in the close makes it feel like a summary slide rather than a lived ending.

> **Current (lines 133-134):**
> You don't have to get it right. You just have to get it started. The hierarchy isn't a test. It's a practice. And the only way to fail is to never begin.

> **Proposed:**
> You don't have to get it right. You just have to get it started.

Shorter. The article has already done the work. Let the reader carry the rest.

### Change 4: Minor voice adjustment -- "Let's walk through an example"

**Why:** Condescension check. "Let's walk through" is a mild instance of teacher-student framing. It is not on the kill-on-sight list, but the Craft Guide flags "Let's break this down" as condescending. "Let's walk through" is softer but same family. Consider replacing.

> **Current (line 84):**
> Let's walk through an example.

> **Proposed:**
> Here's what that looks like with real numbers.

---

### Change 5: The savings section uses "$4,000 monthly income" example twice

**Why:** Factual consistency / craft variety. The same $4,000 income example appears in the Saving section (line 53) and again in the full walkthrough (line 86). This is not a contradiction, but it creates a sense of repetition. Consider either using a different income in one section or acknowledging the continuity ("Using that same $4,000 income...").

> **Current (line 53):**
> On a $4,000 monthly income, that's $40.

> **Proposed (option A -- acknowledge continuity at line 86):**
> **Take-home pay: $4,000/month** (the same example we've been using)

> **Proposed (option B -- different number in savings section):**
> On a $3,500 monthly income, that's $35.

Either works. Option A is simpler.

## Craft Quality

### AI Tells Found
- **Neat conclusion**: Lines 133-134 collect three ideas into one summarizing paragraph. See Change 3.
- **"Let's walk through"**: Line 84. Mild teacher framing. See Change 4.
- **Symmetrical list structure**: Lines 43-45 (three bullet points for giving guidelines) and lines 59-61 (three bullet points for saving guidelines). These work because the content genuinely maps to three different starting positions (already tithing, want to start, not sure where). Not flagged as an AI tell -- the parallelism serves the reader rather than decorating the structure.

### Prose Rhythm: Strong
The opening (lines 13-23) is excellent. The progression from "how much should I give?" to staring at the blank field to closing the app mirrors the reader's actual experience. Short paragraphs alternate with longer explanatory passages. The one-line paragraph "What matters is that you begin." (line 33) lands well after the longer passage about flexibility.

### Reframes Found
- "Imperfect action beats perfect planning. Every time." (line 29) -- Works. Takes the reader's belief that they need the right numbers and inverts it.
- "Your hierarchy is not a contract you sign. It's a conversation you start." (line 31) -- Strong reframe. Reduces the weight of the decision from permanent to iterative.
- "There is no wrong number here. There is only honest and dishonest." (line 47) -- Powerful. Reframes the giving decision from "how much is enough" to "am I being truthful about where I am."
- "Going from $0 to $40 is the hardest jump. Going from $40 to $80 is just a percentage change." (line 55) -- Specific, surprising, and true. Best reframe in the article.
- "Your hierarchy isn't a tattoo. It's a pencil sketch." (line 115) -- Concrete metaphor. Effective.

### Engagement: Pulls forward
The opening scenario (staring at the blank giving field, closing the app) is specific enough to create recognition. Each section after that answers a practical question the reader would logically ask next: How much giving? How much saving? What about bills? What's left? The article follows the reader's actual decision sequence, which keeps it pulling forward.

## Truths Extracted

- "Imperfect action beats perfect planning. Every time." (line 29) -- New candidate truth. Quotable, countercultural in a financial planning context.
- "There is no wrong number here. There is only honest and dishonest." (line 47) -- New candidate truth. Reframes the giving decision entirely.
- "Going from $0 to $40 is the hardest jump. Going from $40 to $80 is just a percentage change." (line 55) -- New candidate truth. Makes the math emotional.
- "Your hierarchy isn't a tattoo. It's a pencil sketch." (line 115) -- New candidate truth. Memorable metaphor.
- "The hierarchy is the constant. The numbers are the variables." (line 121) -- New candidate truth. Clean, quotable.

## Cross-Reference Notes

- **Consistent with "Give First" article** -- The hierarchy order matches (Give, Save, Bills, Safe-to-Spend). The "starting at zero is okay" messaging aligns with Give First lines 79-82.
- **Consistent with "When You're Starting From Zero"** -- The "giving at zero" framing (lines 39-40) aligns with Starting From Zero's argument that the hierarchy works at zero. The language is nearly identical ("not as an accusation but as an invitation" at line 39 vs. Starting From Zero line 41: "Not as an accusation. As an invitation.").
- **Consistent with "Debt and the Hierarchy"** -- The debt article references the Setting Your Hierarchy example structure and extends it with a debt payment layer.
- **$4,000 income example** -- Used here (lines 53, 86) and in the Debt article (line 97). This creates helpful consistency for readers who encounter both articles, but should be acknowledged if both are read in sequence (see Change 5).
- **No contradictions found.**

## Cross-Link Recommendations

### Forward Links (this article to existing)
| Target Article | Suggested Anchor Text | Section | Reason |
|---------------|----------------------|---------|--------|
| The Subscription Audit | already linked (line 73) | Bills section | Good -- already in place |
| The One Number That Tells You the Truth | already linked (line 82) | Safe-to-Spend section | Good -- already in place |
| When You're Starting From Zero | "starting from zero" | Grace for Where You Are (line 103) | Natural connection -- reader who "can't afford to give anything" is the Starting From Zero audience |
| Debt and the Hierarchy | "carrying debt" | Grace for Where You Are (line 103) | Reader with debt needs to know the hierarchy accommodates it |

### Backlinks Needed (existing to this article)
| Source Article | Suggested Anchor Text | Reason |
|---------------|----------------------|--------|
| The One Number That Tells You the Truth | "set your priorities" (line 85-86) | When the Safe-to-Spend article mentions "decide what you give, what you save, and what your bills require," linking to this practical guide would help readers who need the how |
| The Emergency Fund | "hierarchy" references | Multiple mentions of setting up the hierarchy could link here for readers who haven't set theirs up yet |
