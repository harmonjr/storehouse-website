# Content Review: Setting Your Hierarchy: A Practical Guide

**Source:** `projects/storehouse-website/src/content/foundations/setting-your-hierarchy.md`
**Reviewed:** 2026-02-14
**Reviewer:** content-reviewer agent
**Verdict:** PUBLISH_READY with minor revisions (2 medium-priority, 2 low-priority changes)

## Review Summary

This is a strong Tier 2 article that does exactly what it needs to do: take the abstract hierarchy from Articles #1 and #2 and make it concrete with numbers, starting points, and permission to begin imperfectly. The voice is warm, honest, and consistently Storehouse. The piece earns its encouragement by walking through the real paralysis people feel when staring at a blank giving field. At approximately 1,340 words (body text, excluding frontmatter), it lands within the 800-1,500 range with room to spare. The four proposed changes are polish-level -- nothing structural needs to move.

## Filter Questions

| # | Question | Result |
|---|----------|--------|
| 1 | Does this serve stewardship? | PASS -- The entire article is about beginning the practice of stewardship. Line 27: "The person who picks a number -- any honest number -- and starts today is already practicing stewardship." Line 109: "practicing stewardship more faithfully than the person who plans to give 10% and save 20% and never gets around to setting it up." The article frames stewardship as a practice you start, not a standard you meet. |
| 2 | Which pillar does this serve? | PASS -- Primary: **Order** (the entire article is about setting the hierarchy's numbers -- putting first things first). Secondary: **Clarity** (the Safe-to-Spend walkthrough on lines 80-99 makes the math visible). Tertiary: **Peace** (lines 101-111 extend grace to people who cannot give or save much right now). Tertiary: **Margin** (line 97: "the cost of generosity and financial resilience -- and those are things you chose to pay for"). Serves all four pillars with Order as the clear anchor. |
| 3 | Does this make the reader feel equipped and hopeful -- or guilty and overwhelmed? | PASS -- This article is built around removing paralysis, not inducing it. Line 23: "your numbers don't have to be perfect. They just have to be intentional." Line 39: "If you're not giving anything right now, that's okay. Write zero. Be honest about it." Line 44: "Start at 3%. Or 1%. Or $25 a month. Something is infinitely more than nothing." Line 103: "Then don't. Set giving at zero." The tone is consistently permission-giving without being permissive -- it honors the hierarchy while meeting people where they are. |
| 4 | Would Joseph recognize this wisdom? | PASS -- Joseph's stewardship was practical -- he worked with what he had, not what he wished he had. This article's core message is the same: start with honest numbers, not aspirational ones. Line 47: "the most honest number is the one that reflects where you actually are, not where you think you should be." Joseph stored grain during abundance with foresight; this article helps people begin storing with whatever they have now. He would recognize the wisdom of beginning imperfectly over planning perfectly and never starting. |
| 5 | Am I being honest -- or performative? | PASS -- The article earns its honesty credentials immediately. Lines 15-18 describe the paralysis of staring at the giving field with stomach-tightening specificity. Line 39 says "If you're not giving anything right now, that's okay. Write zero." Line 103: "Maybe you read that example and thought, 'I can't afford to give anything right now.' Then don't." The piece never pretends the hierarchy is easy to start. It never promises transformation from setting numbers. It says: begin, and revisit. That is honest. |

## Voice Alignment

### Hits (strong voice moments)

- **Lines 15-18:** "You stare at the blank field. Ten percent feels like the 'right' answer, but ten percent of your income is a number that makes your stomach tighten. Five percent feels like you're not trying hard enough. Zero feels like giving up before you start." -- This is the best opening sequence in the Tier 2 articles. It captures the internal monologue with painful accuracy. Kitchen-table empathy at its finest.

- **Lines 19-20:** "So you close the app. You'll come back to it when you've figured it out." -- Two short sentences that nail the behavioral truth. Every reader who has abandoned an onboarding flow will feel seen.

- **Line 29:** "Imperfect action beats perfect planning. Every time." -- Punchy. Quotable. Feels like Storehouse voice -- warm conviction without lecturing.

- **Lines 39:** "it sits there, not as an accusation but as an invitation" -- Beautiful reframe of what a zero in the giving field means. This is the kind of line that changes how someone feels about their starting point.

- **Line 47:** "the most honest number is the one that reflects where you actually are, not where you think you should be." -- Could be a founding truth. Challenges the guilt-driven instinct to set aspirational targets.

- **Line 115:** "Your hierarchy isn't a tattoo. It's a pencil sketch." -- Memorable metaphor. Simple, warm, instantly understood. This is Storehouse voice at its most natural.

### Misses (voice deviations)

- **Line 97:** "That's real. That's the cost of the hierarchy. But it's also the cost of generosity and financial resilience -- and those are things you chose to pay for, not things that happened to you." -- The phrase "cost of generosity and financial resilience" is slightly clinical. "Financial resilience" is the kind of term a financial planner would use, not a friend at the kitchen table. See Change 2.

- **Line 55:** "That's a car repair. That's a medical copay. That's the difference between 'I can handle this' and 'I need to put this on a credit card.'" -- The triple "That's" construction is effective, but "medical copay" is jargon-adjacent. Most people would say "a doctor visit" or "an ER bill." Minor, but the Content Integrity System says "no financial jargon" and "would my spouse understand this instantly?" See Change 3.

Not applicable -- Storehouse content does not have anonymity requirements.

---

## Factual Consistency

### Internal

- **Hierarchy order (lines 13, 51, 82):** Consistently presented as Give, Save, Bills, Spend throughout. Matches the Content Integrity System hierarchy. PASS.

- **Math in the example (lines 86-94):** $4,000 income - $120 giving - $200 saving - $2,100 bills = $1,580 Safe-to-Spend. The math is correct. The percentages check out: $120 is 3% of $4,000, $200 is 5% of $4,000. PASS.

- **Line 97 claim:** "If this same person increases giving from 0% to 3% and starts saving at 5%, their Safe-to-Spend drops by $320." -- This implies the person was previously at 0% giving and 0% saving, and the $320 drop is the combined $120 + $200 = $320. The math checks out. However, the sentence says "increases giving from 0% to 3%" but the example table already shows giving at 3%. The example is presented as a starting point, not a comparison from zero. This creates a minor logical gap -- the narrative implies the $1,580 is the "after" number, but then asks the reader to "watch what happens when you adjust" as if showing the transition, yet the example already includes the giving and saving. See Change 1.

- **Line 53-55:** "$40 a month is $480 a year" -- correct ($40 x 12 = $480). PASS.

- **Line 59:** "Forty dollars on a $4,000 income" -- 1% of $4,000 is $40. Correct. PASS.

### Cross-content

- **Against Article #1 ("Give First"):** Article #1, line 80: "If you're giving nothing right now, giving $25 is a step. If you're saving nothing, saving 1% of your income is real." Article #5 line 44: "Start at 3%. Or 1%. Or $25 a month." Consistent -- both articles give the same starting-point advice. Article #1 line 78: "The hierarchy isn't a test you pass or fail. It's a direction you face." Article #5 line 107: "the hierarchy is a direction, not a destination." Same metaphor, slightly different phrasing. Consistent and complementary.

- **Against Article #2 ("One Number"):** Article #2 line 28: "Your Income - Giving - Saving - Bills = Safe-to-Spend." Article #5 lines 82-93: The worked example follows this exact formula. Consistent. Article #2 line 75: "an honest number you can trust is worth more than a comfortable number that lies to you." Article #5 line 99: "An honest number you can trust is worth more than a comfortable number that hides the reality." Nearly identical phrasing. See Change 4 for a note on whether this repetition is intentional reinforcement or accidental duplication.

- **Against Article #3 ("Why Budgeting Apps"):** Article #3 line 65: "three decisions at the start (how much to give, save, and set aside for bills)." Article #5 enacts those three decisions section by section (Giving, Saving, Bills). Consistent structural echo.

- **Against Article #4 ("The Weekly Ritual"):** Article #4 line 71: references "the hierarchy from 'Give First, Save Second, Spend What Remains.'" Article #5 line 82: references "'The One Number That Tells You the Truth.'" Both use cross-references naturally. No contradiction.

- **Against Article #6 ("The Subscription Audit"):** Article #5 line 73 says: "We'll talk more about this in 'The Subscription Audit.'" Article #6 exists and covers this topic. The forward reference is valid. Article #5 lines 71-72 describes subscriptions as "money leaving your account with no active consent." Article #6 line 25-26 calls them "money that's already yours but is leaving your account without your active permission." Consistent framing.

- **$4,000 income example:** Article #5 uses $4,000/month as its example income (line 87). Article #2 does not use a specific income figure. Article #6 does not use one either. Article #4 does not use one. Article #1 does not use one. This is the first article to introduce a concrete income figure, which is appropriate for a "practical guide." No conflict.

### Math/claims

- All math checks out. No overpromising. The article does not claim specific savings outcomes beyond what the hierarchy math produces. PASS.

## Truth Extraction

Strong candidates from this piece:

- **"Your numbers don't have to be perfect. They just have to be intentional." (line 23)** -- Quotable independently. Captures the article's core insight. Could be used in onboarding when users are setting up their hierarchy for the first time.

- **"Imperfect action beats perfect planning. Every time." (line 29)** -- Simple, memorable, challenges the perfectionism that stops people from starting. Could be referenced in any article about beginning a financial practice.

- **"The most honest number is the one that reflects where you actually are, not where you think you should be." (line 47)** -- New candidate truth. Addresses guilt-driven target-setting. Could be used in onboarding, in the Safe-to-Spend explanation, and across peace-pillar content.

- **"Your hierarchy isn't a tattoo. It's a pencil sketch." (line 115)** -- Memorable metaphor. Stands alone. Addresses the fear of commitment that paralyzes people. Could be used in the app UI when users revisit their settings.

- **"The hierarchy is the constant. The numbers are the variables." (line 121)** -- Clean separation of principle from practice. Quotable in any context where users worry about getting the numbers "right."

## Red Lines Check

| Red Line | Status |
|----------|--------|
| Shaming people for their financial situation | CLEAR -- The article actively removes shame. "If you're not giving anything right now, that's okay." (line 39). "Maybe you read that example and thought, 'I can't afford to give anything right now.' Then don't." (line 103). Multiple explicit invitations to start at zero. |
| Prosperity gospel messaging | CLEAR -- No promises that giving produces wealth. Giving is framed as a practice, not a transaction with God. |
| Legalistic messaging | CLEAR -- Line 43: "Already tithing 10%? Honor that." This respects the choice without mandating it. Line 44: "Want to start but 10% feels impossible? Start at 3%. Or 1%." No "you must" language anywhere. |
| Attacking competitors by name | CLEAR -- No competitors mentioned. |
| Implying Storehouse replaces professional financial advice | CLEAR -- The article is about setting personal hierarchy targets, not providing financial advice. The actionable step says "Open a blank piece of paper or a note on your phone" -- no app dependency. |
| Fear-based messaging | CLEAR -- No urgency language, no "you'll never retire," no scarcity framing. The tone is entirely permission-giving. |
| Excluding non-Christians from value proposition | CLEAR -- Tithing is mentioned as one option among many (line 43), not as a requirement. The hierarchy is presented as a values-ordering framework, not a religious obligation. A non-Christian reader can follow every step without friction. |

No red line violations.

## Proposed Changes

### Change 1: Fix the logical gap in the Safe-to-Spend comparison

**Priority:** Medium
**Why:** Factual consistency (internal) -- The example on lines 86-94 already includes 3% giving and 5% saving. Then line 97 says "If this same person increases giving from 0% to 3% and starts saving at 5%, their Safe-to-Spend drops by $320." This implies the example shows the "after" state, but the narrative asks the reader to "watch what happens when you adjust" as if showing the transition in real time. The reader cannot see both the "before" and "after" because only the "after" is shown. The $320 figure is correct math, but the framing creates a brief moment of confusion.

> **Current (lines 96-97):**
> Now watch what happens when you adjust. If this same person increases giving from 0% to 3% and starts saving at 5%, their Safe-to-Spend drops by $320. That's real. That's the cost of the hierarchy.

> **Proposed:**
> Consider what this person gained by setting the hierarchy. Before, their entire $1,900 after bills felt available -- but giving and saving weren't happening. Now, $320 goes to generosity and financial resilience before spending begins. Safe-to-Spend drops by $320, but that's not a loss. That's the cost of the hierarchy.

This version makes the before/after comparison explicit instead of asking the reader to reconstruct it, and it frames the $320 as a purposeful redirection rather than a penalty.

### Change 2: Replace "financial resilience" with kitchen-table language

**Priority:** Medium
**Why:** Voice alignment -- "financial resilience" reads like a financial planning term, not a kitchen-table conversation. The Content Integrity System says "no financial jargon" and the tone should be "conversational, honest, like explaining to a friend."

> **Current (line 97):**
> But it's also the cost of generosity and financial resilience -- and those are things you chose to pay for, not things that happened to you.

> **Proposed:**
> But it's also the cost of generosity and having money set aside when life surprises you -- and those are things you chose to pay for, not things that happened to you.

"Having money set aside when life surprises you" says the same thing as "financial resilience" in language anyone would use at the kitchen table.

---

### Change 3: Replace "medical copay" with plain language

**Priority:** Low
**Why:** Voice alignment -- "copay" is health insurance jargon. Not everyone has insurance with copays, and the word pulls the reader into a system-specific context. The sentence works better with universally understood language.

> **Current (line 55):**
> That's a car repair. That's a medical copay. That's the difference between "I can handle this" and "I need to put this on a credit card."

> **Proposed:**
> That's a car repair. That's an urgent trip to the doctor. That's the difference between "I can handle this" and "I need to put this on a credit card."

"An urgent trip to the doctor" is something every reader can picture. "Medical copay" is something only people with specific insurance plans calculate.

---

### Change 4: Vary the "honest number" phrasing to avoid near-duplication with Article #2

**Priority:** Low
**Why:** Cross-content consistency -- Article #2, line 75 says: "an honest number you can trust is worth more than a comfortable number that lies to you." Article #5, line 99 says: "An honest number you can trust is worth more than a comfortable number that hides the reality." These are close enough to feel like accidental repetition rather than intentional reinforcement. Since Article #2 owns this line as a candidate truth, Article #5 should express the same idea in its own voice.

> **Current (line 99):**
> An honest number you can trust is worth more than a comfortable number that hides the reality.

> **Proposed:**
> The number might surprise you. But a number you can trust beats a number that makes you feel better by leaving things out.

This preserves the insight (honest beats comfortable) while giving Article #5 its own phrasing and keeping Article #2's version as the canonical formulation.

## Word Count

Approximately 1,340 words (body text, lines 13-135, excluding frontmatter). Within the 800-1,500 word range specified for educational/blog content. PASS.

## Craft Observations (no Craft Guide exists -- informal notes)

**Prose rhythm:** Strong. The opening four paragraphs (lines 13-23) are a masterclass in building recognition and releasing it with a thesis. Sentence length varies naturally -- short punches ("What matters is that you begin." / "Imperfect action beats perfect planning.") alternate with longer explanatory passages. The sections flow from emotional opening to practical middle to graceful close.

**Opening:** Earns the second paragraph and then some. Lines 13-20 walk the reader through a specific, recognizable moment (staring at the giving field, closing the app) that builds empathy before offering any advice. This is stronger than the Article #4 and #6 openings and comparable to Article #2's opening.

**AI tells:** Very few. No "simply put," no "let's break this down," no filler transitions. The piece reads as human-authored throughout. One minor observation: the "Some guidelines if you're choosing a number" list (lines 41-45) and "Some starting points" list (lines 58-61) use identical structural patterns. This is not an AI tell per se -- it is appropriate for a practical guide -- but a Craft Guide review would note the parallel construction.

**Reframes present:** Yes. "Not as an accusation but as an invitation" (line 39) reframes what a zero in the giving field means. "Your hierarchy isn't a tattoo. It's a pencil sketch." (line 115) reframes the permanence anxiety. "The hierarchy is the constant. The numbers are the variables." (line 121) reframes what can and cannot change. Three genuine reframes, each earning their moment.

**Show vs. tell ratio:** Good. The opening scenario (staring at the blank field, closing the app) is "show." The $4,000 worked example is "show." The "Grace for Where You Are" section (lines 101-111) shows the emotional journey of someone who cannot afford to give. The article balances specific numbers and scenarios with broader principles effectively.

## Cross-Reference Notes

- The "honest number" phrasing on line 99 closely mirrors Article #2, line 75. Change 4 addresses this. If Randy prefers the repetition as intentional reinforcement (a recurring truth), no change is needed -- but it should be a deliberate choice rather than an oversight.
- The $4,000/month income example is new to the corpus. It is realistic and well-chosen (close to US median take-home). Future articles that use income examples should either reference this same figure for consistency or use a different figure with an explicit reason.
- The forward reference to "The Subscription Audit" on line 73 is valid -- Article #6 exists and covers the topic. This is good cross-linking.
- Article #5 bridges the conceptual articles (Articles #1-3) and the practical articles (Articles #4, #6) effectively. It takes the philosophy and turns it into a fill-in-the-blank exercise. This is the right structural role for a Tier 2 Order article.
- The "direction, not a destination" language (line 107) echoes Article #1's "direction you face" (line 78). This is reinforcement, not duplication -- the phrases are different enough to feel like a shared vocabulary rather than a copy.
- No contradictions found across the six articles reviewed.
