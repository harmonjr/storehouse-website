# Content Review: Setting Your Hierarchy: A Practical Guide

**Source:** `projects/storehouse-website/src/content/foundations/setting-your-hierarchy.md`
**Reviewed:** 2026-02-14
**Reviewer:** content-reviewer agent
**Verdict:** Publish-ready with revisions (1 high, 3 medium, 2 low)

## Review Summary

This is a strong Tier 2 Order article that takes the abstract hierarchy from Articles #1 and #2 and turns it into a fill-in-the-blank exercise. The opening (lines 13-20) is among the best in the corpus -- it drops the reader into the specific, recognizable paralysis of staring at a blank giving field. Voice is consistently Storehouse throughout, with several quotable reframes. The main integrity concern is that the article uses the word "stewardship" five times without ever crediting the Bible as its source -- a gap the Content Integrity System explicitly warns against ("Attributive, not vague"). The craft is strong but has a few AI-tell patterns and one section that loses rhythm. Six proposed changes, none structural.

## Filter Questions

| # | Question | Result |
|---|----------|--------|
| 1 | Does this serve stewardship? | PASS -- The entire article is about beginning the practice of stewardship. Line 27: "The person who picks a number -- any honest number -- and starts today is already practicing stewardship." Line 109: "practicing stewardship more faithfully than the person who plans to give 10% and save 20%." The article frames stewardship as a practice you start, not a standard you meet. |
| 2 | Which pillar does this serve? | PASS -- Primary: **Order** (setting the hierarchy's numbers is putting first things first). Secondary: **Clarity** (the Safe-to-Spend walkthrough on lines 80-99 makes the math visible). Tertiary: **Peace** (lines 101-111 extend grace to people who cannot give or save right now). Also touches **Margin** (line 97: the $320 going to generosity and savings is margin being built). |
| 3 | Does this make the reader feel equipped and hopeful -- or guilty and overwhelmed? | PASS -- Built around removing paralysis. Line 23: "your numbers don't have to be perfect. They just have to be intentional." Line 39: "If you're not giving anything right now, that's okay. Write zero." Line 103: "Then don't. Set giving at zero." The tone is permission-giving without being permissive. The guilt test (reading as someone $20,000 in debt, paycheck to paycheck) passes -- that reader would feel invited to start, not ashamed they have not. |
| 4 | Would Joseph recognize this wisdom? | PASS -- Joseph worked with what he had, not what he wished he had. This article's core message is the same: start with honest numbers, not aspirational ones. Joseph stored grain during abundance with foresight; this article helps people begin storing with whatever they have now. He would recognize the wisdom of beginning imperfectly over planning perfectly and never starting. |
| 5 | Am I being honest -- or performative? | PASS -- The article earns its honesty from the first paragraph. Lines 15-18 describe stomach-tightening paralysis. Line 39: "If you're not giving anything right now, that's okay. Write zero." Line 103: "Maybe you read that example and thought, 'I can't afford to give anything right now.' Then don't." It never pretends the hierarchy is easy. It never promises transformation from setting numbers. It says begin, and revisit. That is honest. |

## Voice Alignment

### Hits (strong voice moments)

- **Lines 15-18:** "You stare at the blank field. Ten percent feels like the 'right' answer, but ten percent of your income is a number that makes your stomach tighten." -- Kitchen-table empathy. The reader feels seen before they are told anything.

- **Lines 19-20:** "So you close the app. You'll come back to it when you've figured it out." -- Two sentences that capture the exact behavioral truth. Everyone who has abandoned onboarding feels this.

- **Line 29:** "Imperfect action beats perfect planning. Every time." -- Punchy, quotable, warm conviction without lecturing.

- **Line 39:** "it sits there, not as an accusation but as an invitation" -- A reframe that changes how someone feels about having zero in the giving field.

- **Line 47:** "the most honest number is the one that reflects where you actually are, not where you think you should be" -- Candidate truth. Challenges the guilt-driven instinct to set aspirational targets.

- **Line 115:** "Your hierarchy isn't a tattoo. It's a pencil sketch." -- Memorable metaphor. Simple, warm, instantly understood.

### Misses (voice deviations)

- **Lines 27 and 109:** "practicing stewardship" appears without any biblical attribution anywhere in the article. The Content Integrity System says: "Attributive, not vague -- When a principle comes from the Bible, say so." And: "Biblically grounded, not preachy -- We name the Bible as our source and cite Scripture where it strengthens the point." The word "stewardship" appears five times in this article (lines 27, 109, 119 twice implicitly via "practicing stewardship" and "Stewardship" in the concept). The Craft Guide's Biblical Attribution Standard says to cite when the principle originates from a specific passage. Stewardship as Storehouse uses it is rooted in the parable of the talents (Matthew 25:14-30) and 1 Peter 4:10. This article never names the Bible, never references a passage, never attributes the concept. It treats stewardship as a self-evident idea rather than crediting its source. See Change 1.

- **Line 97 area:** "the cost of generosity and financial resilience" -- "financial resilience" is financial planner language, not kitchen-table language. See Change 3.

- **Line 55:** "That's an urgent trip to the doctor" -- The prior review already caught the original "medical copay" jargon and this was updated, which is good. Current phrasing passes.

---

## Anonymity Check

Not applicable -- Storehouse content does not have anonymity requirements.

---

## Factual Consistency

### Internal

- **Hierarchy order (lines 13, 51, 82):** Consistently Give, Save, Bills, Spend. Matches Content Integrity System. PASS.
- **Math in example (lines 86-94):** $4,000 - $120 - $200 - $2,100 = $1,580. Correct. Percentages check out ($120 = 3%, $200 = 5%). PASS.
- **Line 55:** "$40 a month is $480 a year" -- $40 x 12 = $480. PASS.
- **Line 59:** "Forty dollars on a $4,000 income" -- 1% of $4,000 = $40. PASS.
- **Lines 96-97:** The before/after comparison now works cleanly -- the reader can see that $1,900 after bills becomes $1,580 after giving and saving are added, a $320 difference. PASS.

### Cross-Content

- **Against Article #1 ("Give First"):** Article #1 line 80: "If you're giving nothing right now, giving $25 is a step. If you're saving nothing, saving 1% of your income is real." Article #5 line 44: "Start at 3%. Or 1%. Or $25 a month." Consistent. Article #1 line 52: stewardship is defined with 1 Peter 4:10 citation. Article #5 uses "stewardship" five times but never cites the Bible. This creates an attribution gap. Change 1 addresses this.

- **Against Article #2 ("One Number"):** Article #2 line 28: "Your Income - Giving - Saving - Bills = Safe-to-Spend." Article #5 lines 82-93 follow this formula. Consistent. The near-duplicate "honest number" line was caught in the prior review and appears to have been updated (line 99 now reads differently). PASS.

- **Against Article #8 ("Starting From Zero"):** Article #8 lines 42-43: "Saving at $25 a month feels so small it's not worth doing. It is. Twenty-five dollars a month is $300 in a year. Three hundred dollars is a car repair." Article #5 lines 53-55: "Forty dollars a month is $480 a year. That's a car repair. That's an urgent trip to the doctor." Both use "car repair" as the reference emergency. Consistent and complementary -- different dollar figures grounding the same insight.

- **Against Article #6 ("Subscription Audit"):** Line 73 forward-references "The Subscription Audit" -- Article #6 exists. Valid cross-link.

- **$4,000/month income:** First appearance in the corpus. Realistic (near US median take-home). No conflict with other articles.

### Math/Claims

All math checks out. No overpromising. PASS.

---

## Red Lines Check

| Red Line | Status |
|----------|--------|
| Shaming people for financial situation | CLEAR -- Active shame removal. Lines 39, 103 explicitly invite starting at zero. |
| Prosperity gospel messaging | CLEAR -- No promises that giving produces wealth. |
| Legalistic messaging | CLEAR -- Line 43: "Already tithing 10%? Honor that." Respects without mandating. Line 44: "Start at 3%. Or 1%." No "you must" language. |
| Attacking competitors by name | CLEAR -- No competitors mentioned. |
| Implying Storehouse replaces financial advice | CLEAR -- The actionable step says "Open a blank piece of paper or a note on your phone." No app dependency. |
| Fear-based messaging | CLEAR -- No urgency, no scarcity framing. |
| Excluding non-Christians | CLEAR -- Tithing is one option among many. A non-Christian can follow every step without friction. |

No red line violations.

## Proposed Changes

### Change 1: Add biblical attribution for stewardship

**Priority:** High
**Why:** Voice alignment (Content Integrity System: "Attributive, not vague" and "Biblically grounded, not preachy"). The word "stewardship" appears five times in this article but the Bible is never named as the source. Article #1 properly attributes stewardship to 1 Peter 4:10 and tells the Joseph/Genesis 41 story. This article -- which is about *practicing* stewardship through setting numbers -- never credits the source. The Craft Guide's Biblical Attribution Standard says to cite when the principle originates from a specific passage, and recommends one or two citations per article as the sweet spot. Currently this article has zero. The best location is the "Grace for Where You Are" section (lines 101-111), where the concept of stewardship as direction could be grounded with a brief, natural attribution.

> **Current (lines 107-109):**
> You don't have to restructure your finances to start. You just increase a number.
>
> There is no hierarchy configuration that's too small to start with. The person who sets giving at $10 and saving at $25 and follows through is practicing stewardship more faithfully than the person who plans to give 10% and save 20% and never gets around to setting it up.

> **Proposed:**
> You don't have to restructure your finances to start. You just increase a number.
>
> There is a principle in Scripture -- that God asks us to manage faithfully what we've been given, not to wait until we have more of it (Matthew 25:14-30). The servant who invested two talents wasn't judged against the servant who had five. He was judged by what he did with what he had. That is what the hierarchy is asking of you. The person who sets giving at $10 and saving at $25 and follows through is practicing stewardship more faithfully than the person who plans to give 10% and save 20% and never gets around to setting it up.

This adds one biblical citation (the parable of the talents), weaves it naturally into the text as the Craft Guide prescribes (not as an academic footnote), and grounds the concept of stewardship in its actual source. It also introduces the insight that faithfulness is measured against what you have, not what someone else has -- which reinforces the article's core message of starting where you are.

---

### Change 2: Tighten the transition into the Safe-to-Spend section

**Priority:** Medium
**Why:** Craft quality (prose rhythm, engagement). Lines 80-82 contain a header, a sentence that largely restates the hierarchy, and a cross-reference. The cross-reference to Article #2 is good, but the line "This is the number from 'The One Number That Tells You the Truth'" does two things at once (defines Safe-to-Spend and links to Article #2) without doing either one sharply. The Craft Guide says each section should create curiosity for the next. This transition is functional but flat.

> **Current (lines 80-82):**
> ## Safe-to-Spend: Your Truth
>
> After giving, saving, and bills, what remains is your Safe-to-Spend. This is the number from "The One Number That Tells You the Truth" -- the honest answer to "what can I freely spend?"

> **Proposed:**
> ## Safe-to-Spend: The Honest Answer
>
> After giving, saving, and bills, what remains is your Safe-to-Spend -- the number from "The One Number That Tells You the Truth." It answers one question: what can I freely spend without undoing anything I just set up?

The revised header avoids repeating "Your" (the prior section is "Safe-to-Spend: Your Truth" and the one before is "Bills: Be Ruthlessly Honest" -- three possessive/imperative headers in a row). "The Honest Answer" is more specific. The revised body puts the cross-reference in a natural subordinate clause and sharpens the definition by connecting it back to the hierarchy the reader just built.

---

### Change 3: Replace "financial resilience" with kitchen-table language

**Priority:** Medium
**Why:** Voice alignment -- "financial resilience" reads like a financial planning term. The Content Integrity System tone is "conversational, honest, like explaining to a friend." The Craft Guide's condescension radar says not to use jargon when plain language exists.

> **Current (line 97):**
> Now, $320 goes to generosity and financial resilience before spending begins.

> **Proposed:**
> Now, $320 goes to generosity and having money set aside when life surprises you.

"Having money set aside when life surprises you" says the same thing as "financial resilience" in language anyone would use at a kitchen table.

---

### Change 4: Vary the bullet structure in the Saving section

**Priority:** Medium
**Why:** AI tells (symmetrical structure). The Giving section (lines 41-45) uses a three-bullet list with bold-then-question format. The Saving section (lines 58-61) uses an identical three-bullet list with the same format. The Bills section (lines 75-77) uses a two-item numbered list. The Craft Guide specifically warns: "AI defaults to three parallel items with matching structure. Three benefits. Three risks. Three reasons. Always three, always symmetrical." Two identical three-item lists in consecutive sections triggers this pattern. The saving section could vary the delivery.

> **Current (lines 57-63):**
> Some starting points:
>
> - **No savings at all?** Start at 1%. Forty dollars on a $4,000 income.
> - **Some savings but inconsistent?** Set a number you can sustain every single month, even if it's smaller than your best month.
> - **Already saving 10-15%?** Write that down and protect it. The hierarchy ensures it comes out before spending, not after.
>
> The goal isn't a specific percentage. The goal is structural consistency.

> **Proposed:**
> If you have no savings, start at 1%. On a $4,000 monthly income, that is $40. It will not feel like enough. It is.
>
> If you are saving inconsistently -- big deposits some months, nothing others -- pick the number you can sustain every single month, even if it is smaller than your best month. Consistency beats ambition here.
>
> If you are already saving 10-15%, write that down and protect it. The hierarchy ensures it comes out before spending, not after.
>
> The goal is not a specific percentage. The goal is structural consistency.

This delivers the same three scenarios but in flowing prose paragraphs instead of a bullet list that mirrors the prior section's format. The Giving section keeps its bullets (appropriate for a first walkthrough), and the Saving section uses a different structure, breaking the symmetry.

---

### Change 5: Sharpen the final paragraph to avoid neat-conclusion pattern

**Priority:** Low
**Why:** AI tells (neat conclusions). The Craft Guide warns: "AI wraps everything up. Every section resolves. Every article ends with a bow." The final two sentences on line 134 -- "The hierarchy isn't a test. It's a practice. And the only way to fail is to never begin." -- are good individually, but "the only way to fail is to never begin" is a motivational-poster formulation. It is the kind of line that sounds good but does not stick because the reader has heard its shape before. The article earns a better closing.

> **Current (line 134):**
> You don't have to get it right. You just have to get it started. The hierarchy isn't a test. It's a practice. And the only way to fail is to never begin.

> **Proposed:**
> You don't have to get it right. You just have to get it started. The hierarchy is not a test you pass or fail. It is a pencil sketch you keep refining.

This callback to the "pencil sketch" metaphor from line 115 is stronger than the generic "only way to fail" formulation. It closes the article with its own best image rather than a borrowed motivational structure.

---

### Change 6: Remove "Something Is Everything" from the Saving section header

**Priority:** Low
**Why:** Voice alignment -- "Something Is Everything" is a paradoxical construction that reads as a tagline rather than a kitchen-table conversation. The Craft Guide warns against lines that sound clever without being specific. The section content is excellent; the header overpromises a philosophical reframe when the section delivers practical starting points.

> **Current (line 49):**
> ## Saving: Something Is Everything

> **Proposed:**
> ## Saving: Start at 1%

"Start at 1%" is specific, actionable, and tells the reader exactly what the section will help them do. It matches the directness of the other headers ("Giving: Start Where You Are," "Bills: Be Ruthlessly Honest").

---

## Word Count

Approximately 1,340 words (body text, lines 13-135, excluding frontmatter). Within the 800-1,500 word range for educational/blog content. With Change 1 adding the biblical attribution, the piece will be approximately 1,420 words -- still within range. PASS.

---

## Craft Quality

### AI Tells Found

- **Symmetrical structure:** The Giving bullet list (lines 42-45) and Saving bullet list (lines 58-61) use identical three-item, bold-question format in consecutive sections. (lines 42-61) --> Change 4 addresses this.
- **Neat conclusion:** "And the only way to fail is to never begin." (line 134) -- motivational-poster formulation that smooths over the rough edges the rest of the article respects. --> Change 5 addresses this.
- **"Something Is Everything":** (line 49) -- paradoxical tagline construction. AI loves these inversions as headers. --> Change 6 addresses this.
- **Minor: "It's Not X, It's Y" device usage:** The article uses this construction five times: "not a contract... a conversation" (line 31), "not as an accusation but as an invitation" (line 39), "a direction, not a destination" (line 107), "not a tattoo... a pencil sketch" (line 115), "the constant... the variables" (line 121). Five uses is on the edge. The Craft Guide says: "Use it once, powerfully, then find other structures." However, in a practical guide where the entire point is reframing the reader's relationship to their numbers, the device earns its repetition more than it would in a general article. Flagging but not recommending a change -- Randy's call on whether to trim one or two.

### Prose Rhythm: Strong

The opening four paragraphs (lines 13-23) are excellent -- sentence length varies naturally, building recognition and releasing with a thesis. Short punches ("What matters is that you begin." / "Imperfect action beats perfect planning. Every time.") alternate with longer explanatory passages. The piece breathes well. One flat spot: lines 80-82 (the Safe-to-Spend transition) are functional but lack the energy of the surrounding sections -- Change 2 addresses this.

### Reframes Found

- "it sits there, not as an accusation but as an invitation" (line 39) -- Reframes a zero in the giving field from failure to possibility. Works because it names the emotion the reader is already feeling (accusation) and inverts it.
- "Your hierarchy isn't a tattoo. It's a pencil sketch." (line 115) -- Reframes the permanence anxiety. Vivid, instantly understood, memorable. The best reframe in the piece.
- "The hierarchy is the constant. The numbers are the variables." (line 121) -- Reframes what can and cannot change. Clean separation of principle from practice.
- "the hierarchy is a direction, not a destination" (line 107) -- Reframes the standard from achievement to orientation. Echoes Article #1 naturally.

Four genuine reframes, each earning their moment. The Craft Guide asks for "at least one." This article has four. Strong.

### The "Changed Inside" Test

**Reframes present:** Yes, four (see above).

**Conclusion earned or stated upfront?** Partially earned. The thesis appears on line 23: "your numbers don't have to be perfect. They just have to be intentional." This is early, but the article then walks the reader through the sections to make the thesis concrete rather than just asserting it. The journey through each tier (giving, saving, bills, Safe-to-Spend) shows the reader what intentional looks like, which earns the closing. However, "the only way to fail is to never begin" (line 134) is a restatement of the thesis without new insight. Change 5 addresses this.

**Show vs. tell ratio:** Good. The opening scenario (staring at the blank field, closing the app) is show. The $4,000 worked example is show. The "Grace for Where You Are" section shows the emotional journey. The article balances specific numbers and scenarios with broader principles effectively.

### Condescension Check

- No "simply put," "let me explain," or "let's break this down." CLEAR.
- No over-explanation of obvious concepts. The article explains things by showing the math, not by lecturing about why the math matters. CLEAR.
- The reader is treated as an intelligent adult who is stuck, not ignorant. The paralysis is framed as a reasonable response to a hard question, not as a problem to be fixed. CLEAR.
- **One edge case:** "Let's walk through an example." (line 84) is borderline. It is a mild version of "let me explain." In this context it works because the reader genuinely needs the example and the tone is collaborative ("let's") rather than instructive. PASS, but flagging for awareness.

### Engagement: Pulls forward through the Giving section, holds through Safe-to-Spend, softens at the close

The opening (lines 13-23) pulls hard. The Giving section (lines 35-47) sustains. The Saving section (lines 49-63) is solid but its structural parallel to Giving slightly reduces surprise. Bills (lines 65-78) introduces a new idea (fixed vs. forgotten) that re-engages. Safe-to-Spend (lines 80-99) delivers the concrete payoff the article has been building toward. "Grace for Where You Are" (lines 101-111) is emotionally strong. "Revisit, Don't Regret" (lines 113-121) contains the best metaphor. The close (lines 123-135) is the weakest section -- it is a call-to-action that repeats what the article has already said. Change 5 tightens it.

---

## Truths Extracted

- **"Your numbers don't have to be perfect. They just have to be intentional." (line 23)** -- Quotable independently. Could be used in onboarding when users set up their hierarchy. Challenges the perfectionism that prevents people from starting.

- **"Imperfect action beats perfect planning. Every time." (line 29)** -- Simple, memorable, broadly applicable. Could be referenced in any article about beginning a financial practice.

- **"The most honest number is the one that reflects where you actually are, not where you think you should be." (line 47)** -- New candidate truth. Addresses guilt-driven target-setting. Usable in onboarding, Safe-to-Spend explanation, and peace-pillar content.

- **"Your hierarchy isn't a tattoo. It's a pencil sketch." (line 115)** -- Best metaphor in the piece. Stands alone. Addresses permanence anxiety. Could appear in app UI when users revisit settings.

- **"The hierarchy is the constant. The numbers are the variables." (line 121)** -- Clean, structural, quotable. Usable whenever users worry about getting numbers "right."

---

## Cross-Reference Notes

- **Biblical attribution gap:** Article #1 attributes stewardship to 1 Peter 4:10 and tells the Joseph/Genesis 41 story. Article #8 ("Starting From Zero") references Joseph and God's wisdom. This article -- the practical guide to *doing* stewardship -- never names the Bible. For a reader encountering this article first (plausible for a Tier 2 practical piece), the stewardship concept floats without its anchor. Change 1 addresses this.

- **$4,000/month income example:** First appearance in the corpus. Realistic and well-chosen. Future articles using income examples should reference this figure for consistency or use a different figure with an explicit reason.

- **"Direction, not a destination" (line 107) vs. Article #1's "direction you face" (line 78):** This is reinforcement, not duplication -- different enough to feel like shared vocabulary.

- **Forward reference to "The Subscription Audit" (line 73):** Valid cross-link. Article #6 exists and covers the topic.

- **The "It's Not X, It's Y" device:** Used five times in this article. Article #1 uses it at least three times. Across the two articles, the device appears eight or more times. This is not a problem within either article individually, but across the corpus it is becoming a signature tic. Worth monitoring in future reviews.

- **Overlap with Article #8 ("Starting From Zero"):** Both articles address the reader who cannot afford to give. Article #5 lines 39-40 and 103-107 cover this briefly; Article #8 devotes its entire 1,100 words to it. The overlap is appropriate -- Article #5 gives permission and moves on, Article #8 goes deep. No conflict. The articles complement each other well.

- **No contradictions found** across the six articles reviewed (#1, #2, #5, #6, #8, plus spot-checks against #3 and #4).
