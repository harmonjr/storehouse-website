# Content Review: Irregular Income and the Hierarchy

**Source:** `projects/storehouse-website/src/content/foundations/irregular-income-and-the-hierarchy.md`
**Reviewed:** 2026-02-14
**Reviewer:** content-reviewer agent
**Verdict:** Needs revision (1 high-priority, 4 medium-priority changes)

## Review Summary

This is a strong piece with a vivid opening, clean structure, and a genuine reframe at its center. The "free money trap" setup earns the reader's trust, the freelancer baseline section extends the article's reach, and "Buy the shoes. Take the trip. Enjoy the dinner." is the Storehouse voice at its most encouraging. However, the article has a significant gap: it contains zero biblical attribution. Not one mention of God, Scripture, the Bible, or any biblical story. The word "stewardship" appears twice (lines 59, 65) as a floating concept with no anchor. For a platform whose Voice Guidelines require being "Attributive, not vague" and whose Craft Guide includes a Biblical Attribution Standard specifying that "when the principle originates from a specific passage... say so," this is not a minor omission -- it is the single most important thing to address. The hierarchy's foundation in biblical stewardship needs to be named once, directly, without turning the article into a sermon.

## Filter Questions

| # | Question | Result |
|---|----------|--------|
| 1 | Does this serve stewardship? | PASS -- The entire article argues that irregular income deserves the same intentional management as regular income. Line 27: "Every dollar carries the same question: what do you want this to become?" Line 65: "the habits you practice with irregular income reveal the habits you're building overall." Both serve the stewardship principle. |
| 2 | Which pillar does this serve? | PASS -- Primarily **Order** (applying the hierarchy to a category of income that typically bypasses it). Also serves **Margin** (freelancer baseline protects margin in lean months, lines 73-79) and **Clarity** (making visible the mechanism by which windfalls vanish, lines 33-35). Frontmatter correctly lists `pillar: "order"`. |
| 3 | Does this make the reader feel equipped and hopeful -- or guilty and overwhelmed? | PASS -- The opening names the guilt sequence honestly (line 15: "Your third thought is guilt about the first thought") then systematically removes it. Lines 85-87: "Buy the shoes. Take the trip. Enjoy the dinner. The guilt dissolves when the priorities are already handled." The "Yes, Enjoy Some of It" section is deliberately placed to ensure the reader does not walk away feeling deprived. |
| 4 | Would Joseph recognize this wisdom? | PASS -- Joseph stored surplus during abundance with foresight. A windfall is precisely a moment of unexpected abundance, and the article prescribes directing it through the hierarchy before it dissipates -- Joseph's approach. However, Joseph is not mentioned. The wisdom is present; the attribution is not. See Change 1. |
| 5 | Am I being honest -- or performative? | PASS -- The article does not claim the author has perfectly handled every bonus. The opening is second person, sidestepping performative "we always do this." The freelancer section acknowledges real difficulty: "your Safe-to-Spend reflects reality at its leanest" (line 77). The "Yes, Enjoy Some of It" section is honest about the tension between discipline and enjoyment. |

## Voice Alignment

### Hits (strong voice moments)

- **Lines 13-15 (opening):** "The bonus hits your account on a Thursday afternoon. Three thousand dollars, after taxes." The specificity of "Thursday afternoon" makes this feel lived. The three-thought sequence (buy, save, guilt) is immediately recognizable.

- **Line 25:** "That feeling is the trap." -- Five words after a paragraph of building tension. The brevity forces the reader to stop.

- **Line 27:** "There's no such thing as free money. Every dollar carries the same question: what do you want this to become?" -- Truth candidate. Reframes the dollar from something you have to something you direct.

- **Lines 33-34:** "Tax refund arrives in March -- $2,400. By May, it's gone. You can't quite say where." -- Compression of timeline plus the honest "You can't quite say where" captures the universal experience.

- **Line 57:** "Same money. One version builds margin and meaning. The other just raises the waterline temporarily." -- "Waterline" echoes the Lifestyle Creep article's "water level" metaphor. Good cross-article consistency.

- **Lines 85-87:** "Buy the shoes. Take the trip. Enjoy the dinner." -- Staccato imperative rhythm gives visceral permission. Storehouse voice at its best.

- **Line 91:** "That's the rhythm. Not restriction. Direction." -- Clean two-beat close. Could stand as a signature phrase.

- **Line 99:** "The dollars that arrive with a plan become building blocks. The ones that arrive without a plan become a story you can't quite piece together three months later." -- Sharp contrast. Truth candidate.

### Misses (voice deviations)

- **Lines 59-65 ("A Windfall Is a Stewardship Test" section):** The word "stewardship" appears twice (lines 61, 65) without any biblical grounding. The Integrity System Voice Guidelines (line 95) require "Biblically grounded, not preachy" and (line 97) "Attributive, not vague -- When a principle comes from the Bible, say so." The Craft Guide's Biblical Attribution Standard (lines 289-290) states: "Cite when the principle originates from a specific passage. The firstfruits concept comes from Proverbs 3:9 -- say so." The concept of stewardship -- managing what God has entrusted to you -- originates from Scripture. Using it as a floating concept with no anchor is the "ancient wisdom" vagueness the Voice Guidelines explicitly reject. This is not about turning the section into a Bible study. One sentence is enough. See Change 1.

- **Line 41:** "When irregular income arrives, run it through the hierarchy before you spend any of it." -- This line was already revised from an earlier draft but the section heading "The Same Hierarchy, Applied to Every Dollar" is the only section title that reads like a subheading from a manual rather than a claim or observation. Compare to "The 'Free Money' Trap," "Why Windfalls Vanish," "A Windfall Is a Stewardship Test." Those are assertions. "The Same Hierarchy, Applied to Every Dollar" is a description. See Change 3.

- **Line 47:** The sentence jumps from 3% regular giving to suggesting 5-10% windfall giving. The Content Integrity System (line 200) flags "Generic percentage advice" without acknowledging that some families are starting from 0%. The current text does include "whatever feels generous without feeling forced" and "Even $150 toward something meaningful," which soften this. However, the three specific percentages (3%, 5%, 10%) in quick succession could read as a sliding scale with 10% as the destination. Minor concern. See Change 2.

## Anonymity Check

Not applicable -- Storehouse content does not have anonymity requirements.

---

## Factual Consistency

### Internal

- **$3,000 bonus allocation table (lines 51-55):** $300 (10%) + $1,200 (40%) + $1,500 (50%) = $3,000. Math is correct.

- **$2,400 tax refund example (line 33):** Illustrative amount, no calculations attached. Consistent.

- **Freelancer baseline advice (line 75):** "Look at your last six months of income, find the lowest month, and use that as your baseline." Practical heuristic, does not constitute professional financial advice. Appropriate.

- No internal contradictions found.

### Cross-content

- **Against Article #1 ("Give First, Save Second, Spend What Remains"):** Article #1 includes direct biblical citations -- 1 Peter 4:10 (line 52), Genesis 41 / Joseph story (lines 54-56), and attributes stewardship to its biblical origin. Article #10 uses the word "stewardship" without any biblical grounding. This creates an inconsistency: the foundational article grounds the hierarchy in Scripture, but this article treats the same concepts as secular principles. A reader encountering Article #10 first would not know the hierarchy has a biblical foundation. This is the primary issue. See Change 1.

- **Against Article #9 ("Lifestyle Creep"):** Line 35 references the same mechanism. The cross-reference to the article title is present ("Lifestyle Creep: The Silent Margin Thief"). This connection works well.

- **Against Article #11 ("Debt and the Hierarchy"):** Article #11 modifies the hierarchy to include a debt-attack tier. Article #10 does not mention debt. Line 69 already includes a cross-reference: "If you're in a season of debt payoff, 'Debt and the Hierarchy' shows how the hierarchy adjusts." This bridge works. No action needed.

- **Against Article #5 ("Setting Your Hierarchy"):** Article #5 line 17 presents 10% as the percentage that "makes your stomach tighten." Article #10 line 47 uses a range (5-10%) for windfall giving. The contexts are different (monthly vs. one-time), and the range softens it. Minor tension but not a contradiction.

- **Against Article #8 ("When You're Starting From Zero"):** Article #8 line 83 explicitly mentions God: "God gave Joseph wisdom to steward during famine, not just during plenty." Article #10 mentions neither God nor Joseph. The contrast is noticeable across the series.

- **"Waterline" metaphor consistency:** Article #10 line 57 ("raises the waterline") echoes Article #9 line 31 ("let the water level rise one millimeter at a time"). Good. Same image for the same concept across articles.

- **Allocation table format:** Lines 51-55 follow the same Priority/Amount/Notes format used in Article #5 (lines 88-93) and Article #11 (lines 99-105). Consistent.

- No factual contradictions found across any cross-referenced articles.

## Red Lines Check

| Red Line | Status |
|----------|--------|
| Shaming people for their financial situation | CLEAR -- The opening names guilt as universal (line 15), not a character flaw. "Buy the shoes. Take the trip. Enjoy the dinner." (line 87) validates enjoyment. No shame language. |
| Prosperity gospel messaging | CLEAR -- No promises that following the hierarchy produces wealth. "Margin and meaning" (line 57) is the promised outcome, not prosperity. |
| Legalistic messaging | CLEAR -- "The percentages don't have to match your regular allocations" (line 45). The allocation table is labeled "An example" (line 49). No mandatory targets. |
| Attacking competitors by name | CLEAR -- No competitor names mentioned. |
| Implying Storehouse replaces professional financial advice | CLEAR -- Freelancer advice is a practical heuristic, not professional planning. |
| Fear-based messaging | CLEAR -- "That's not pressure. It's clarity." (line 65). Explicitly reframes singularity as clarity, not urgency. |
| Excluding non-Christians from value proposition | CLEAR -- The hierarchy is presented as a universal framework. However, the absence of ANY faith language actually overcorrects. The Integrity System says to be "transparent about the biblical source without requiring readers to share the belief" (line 216). The article is so secular that it obscures the source entirely. See Change 1. |

No red line violations. But the absence of biblical attribution, while not a red line violation per se, conflicts with the "Attributive, not vague" voice guideline.

## Word Count

Body text (lines 13-101, excluding frontmatter): approximately 1,300 words. Within the 800-1,500 word target. No action needed.

---

## Proposed Changes

### Change 1: Add biblical attribution for the stewardship concept

**Priority:** High
**Why:** Voice alignment ("Attributive, not vague"), Biblical Attribution Standard, cross-content consistency

This is the most important change. The article uses "stewardship" twice (lines 61, 65) and "stewardship test" as a section header (line 59) without ever grounding the concept in its biblical origin. Every other article in the Foundations series that uses "stewardship" provides at least a brief anchor:

- Article #1 cites 1 Peter 4:10 and retells the Joseph story
- Article #8 mentions "God gave Joseph wisdom to steward during famine"
- Article #11 references giving as a practice with roots in the hierarchy's biblical foundation

Article #10 is the only Foundations piece that uses "stewardship" as a floating concept. The Voice Guidelines are explicit: "When a principle comes from the Bible, say so" (Integrity System line 97). The Craft Guide's Biblical Attribution Standard says to "cite when the principle originates from a specific passage" and to "credit God as the source of wisdom" (Craft Guide lines 289, 309).

The fix does not require a sermon. One sentence, woven into the "A Windfall Is a Stewardship Test" section, would anchor the concept without disrupting the article's practical tone.

> **Current (lines 61-65):**
> Regular income gives you practice -- every month, you run the hierarchy, and if you miss a month, the next one comes around. Windfalls don't work that way. The bonus arrives once. The tax refund comes once a year. The freelance check clears and that project is over. There's no next month to try again with that specific money.
>
> That's not pressure. It's clarity. When the opportunity is singular, the intentionality matters more. Not because you'll be judged for how you handle a bonus, but because the habits you practice with irregular income reveal the habits you're building overall.

> **Proposed (lines 61-65):**
> Regular income gives you practice -- every month, you run the hierarchy, and if you miss a month, the next one comes around. Windfalls don't work that way. The bonus arrives once. The tax refund comes once a year. The freelance check clears and that project is over. There's no next month to try again with that specific money.
>
> That's not pressure. It's clarity. The Bible calls this stewardship -- faithfully managing what God has entrusted to you, whether the amount is expected or not. When the opportunity is singular, the intentionality matters more. Not because you'll be judged for how you handle a bonus, but because the habits you practice with irregular income reveal the habits you're building overall.

The inserted sentence ("The Bible calls this stewardship -- faithfully managing what God has entrusted to you, whether the amount is expected or not") does three things: (1) names the Bible as the source, satisfying the "Attributive, not vague" guideline, (2) defines stewardship in a way that connects to the article's windfall theme with "whether the amount is expected or not," and (3) keeps the tone conversational rather than sermonic. It does not require the reader to share the belief -- it simply names the source.

Alternative approach if the mid-paragraph insertion feels too heavy: add the attribution in the section header's opening line instead.

> **Proposed (alternative, replace line 61):**
> Here's the reframe: a windfall isn't free money. It's a stewardship test with higher stakes and no monthly reset. Stewardship -- the biblical conviction that what you have is entrusted, not owned -- applies to the dollars you expected and the ones you didn't.

---

### Change 2: Widen the giving percentage range in the example

**Priority:** Medium
**Why:** Financial accuracy / Red lines proximity -- The Content Integrity System (line 200) flags "Generic percentage advice" and notes the importance of "acknowledging that some families are starting from 0% and 5% would be a victory." Line 47 currently offers a range (5-10%) with softening language ("whatever feels generous without feeling forced"), which is already better than anchoring to a single number. However, the sentence still presents three specific percentages (3%, 5%, 10%) in quick succession, and the dollar amount example ($150) corresponds to the 5% figure. The 10% remains the upper anchor. Article #5 ("Setting Your Hierarchy") explicitly names 10% as the percentage that "makes your stomach tighten." A slight rebalance could further de-emphasize 10% as a target.

> **Current (line 47):**
> If you're giving at 3% of your regular income, a $3,000 bonus is a chance to stretch -- maybe 5%, maybe 10%, whatever feels generous without feeling forced. Even $150 toward something meaningful is more than the zero that happens when the bonus just absorbs into spending.

> **Proposed:**
> If you're giving at 3% of your regular income, a $3,000 bonus is a chance to stretch. Maybe that means $150. Maybe it means $300. The amount matters less than the act of deciding before the money disappears. Even a modest increase over your regular percentage is more than the zero that happens when the bonus just absorbs into spending.

This removes all percentage anchors from the sentence, substitutes dollar amounts (which feel more personal and less rule-like), and refocuses on the act of deciding rather than hitting a specific target. The allocation table at lines 51-55 still shows 10% / $300 as the example, which is fine because tables are clearly illustrative.

---

### Change 3: Strengthen the section heading for "The Same Hierarchy, Applied to Every Dollar"

**Priority:** Medium
**Why:** Voice alignment / Prose rhythm -- This is the only section heading that reads as descriptive rather than assertive. Compare to the article's other headings: "The 'Free Money' Trap" (an assertion), "Why Windfalls Vanish" (a question that implies a story), "A Windfall Is a Stewardship Test" (a reframe), "Yes, Enjoy Some of It" (permission). "The Same Hierarchy, Applied to Every Dollar" reads like a manual subheading.

> **Current (line 39):**
> ## The Same Hierarchy, Applied to Every Dollar

> **Proposed:**
> ## Every Dollar Gets the Same Question

This echoes line 27 ("Every dollar carries the same question: what do you want this to become?") and creates a callback that ties the section to the article's core philosophical claim. It is assertive rather than descriptive, matching the voice of the other headings.

Alternative:

> **Proposed (alternative):**
> ## The Hierarchy Doesn't Care Where the Dollar Came From

This echoes line 27's framing ("The hierarchy doesn't care whether a dollar arrived on the 1st of the month or the 15th") and has more personality than the current heading.

---

### Change 4: Tighten the closing section's final paragraph to avoid repetition

**Priority:** Medium
**Why:** Craft quality / Prose rhythm -- The closing section (lines 93-101) contains three paragraphs. The first (lines 95-97) gives the practical instruction (write down the amount, split it through the hierarchy). The second (lines 97-99) provides the "building blocks vs. story you can't piece together" contrast -- a strong truth. The third (line 101) restates the hierarchy mantra. The issue is that the second and third paragraphs both function as closings. "Same dollars. Different outcome. The only variable is whether you decided before the money decided for you." (line 99) is a strong ending. Then line 101 restates the mantra: "Give first. Save second. Spend what remains. Every dollar. Even -- especially -- the ones you didn't expect." This is also a strong ending. Having two strong endings in sequence dilutes both.

> **Current (lines 97-101):**
> Decide the giving, the saving, and the spending before the deposit hits your account. Write it on a sticky note or a phone note. When the money arrives, execute the plan.
>
> The dollars that arrive with a plan become building blocks. The ones that arrive without a plan become a story you can't quite piece together three months later. Same dollars. Different outcome. The only variable is whether you decided before the money decided for you.
>
> Give first. Save second. Spend what remains. Every dollar. Even -- especially -- the ones you didn't expect.

> **Proposed:**
> Decide the giving, the saving, and the spending before the deposit hits your account. Write it on a sticky note or a phone note. When the money arrives, execute the plan.
>
> The dollars that arrive with a plan become building blocks. The ones that arrive without a plan become a story you can't quite piece together three months later.
>
> Give first. Save second. Spend what remains. Every dollar. Even -- especially -- the ones you didn't expect.

This removes "Same dollars. Different outcome. The only variable is whether you decided before the money decided for you." from line 99. The "building blocks vs. story" contrast is strong enough to stand alone, and it hands off cleanly to the mantra restatement. The "decided before the money decided for you" phrasing, while clever, is thematically redundant with the "building blocks vs. story" contrast (both say the same thing: plan beats no plan). Cutting it lets each closing paragraph do one thing.

Note: If "decided before the money decided for you" is a line worth keeping, it could replace "The only variable is whether you decided before the money decided for you" with just the final clause as a standalone fragment -- but that may feel like too much craft-surgery for a closing that already works well.

---

### Change 5: Consider a brief admission of imperfection

**Priority:** Low
**Why:** Voice alignment ("Honest about struggle") / Craft Guide "Neat Conclusions" watchlist -- The article is written entirely in second person, which gives it a confident, instructional tone. Every other Tier 3-4 article in the series includes at least one moment of first-person admission -- a "we've been there" or "we're still figuring this out." Article #1 line 76: "We've been there." Article #8 line 16: "Stay. This one is for you." Article #9 line 47: "And you do. That's the honest truth." Article #10 has no such moment. The "Yes, Enjoy Some of It" section (lines 83-89) comes closest with "We need to say this plainly" (line 85), which acknowledges the tension. But nowhere does the article admit that the author has ever failed to run a windfall through the hierarchy. The Craft Guide's "Voice of Experience" section (line 275) values "admissions of uncertainty or failure" as credibility builders.

This is a low-priority suggestion because the second-person voice works well and the article does not feel preachy. But one brief admission -- even a phrase -- would ground the "stewardship test" framing in lived experience rather than instruction.

> **Current (line 85):**
> We need to say this plainly: the hierarchy isn't about eliminating enjoyment.

> **Proposed:**
> We need to say this plainly -- because we've been on the other side of it, watching a bonus dissolve into nothing memorable: the hierarchy isn't about eliminating enjoyment.

This is optional. The current sentence works. The proposed version adds a single autobiographical clause that signals experience without derailing the paragraph.

## Craft Quality

### AI Tells Found

- **Rule of three:** Line 15: "Your first thought is what you'd buy. Your second thought is that you should probably save it. Your third thought is guilt about the first thought." -- This IS a rule of three, but it works because it mirrors actual psychology (the real sequence people experience) and the third item subverts the pattern (guilt about thought one, not a tidy third option). Not a problem. Intentional craft.

- **Rule of three:** Line 17: "excitement, responsibility, guilt" -- Summary of the above. Same verdict: the three items are psychologically accurate, not symmetrically constructed.

- **Neat conclusion tendency:** Lines 97-101 contain two closings stacked on top of each other. The "building blocks vs. story" contrast is strong. Then "Same dollars. Different outcome." restates it. Then the mantra restates the whole article. This is the one place where the article wraps up a little too neatly. See Change 4.

- **No hedge phrases found.** The article is direct throughout.

- **No filler transitions found.** Section openings are assertions or observations, not meta-signals.

- **No passive hedging found.** The article owns its claims.

- **No "It's not X, it's Y" overuse.** The device appears once: "That's not pressure. It's clarity." (line 65). Used once, effectively.

- **No emotional flatness.** The opening scenario (lines 13-17) evokes the feeling rather than describing it. "You can't quite say where" (line 34) is specific and emotionally honest.

**AI Tells Count: 1 flagged (double closing at lines 97-101). No significant AI fingerprint. This reads as human-written.**

### Prose Rhythm: Strong

The article varies sentence length effectively. Line 25 ("That feeling is the trap.") is five words after a full paragraph. Line 57 alternates long and short: "Same money. One version builds margin and meaning. The other just raises the waterline temporarily." The freelancer section (lines 71-81) builds a longer argument, then line 81 delivers a two-sentence payoff: "The baseline handles the fear. The windfall gets the freedom." The rhythm pulls the reader forward consistently.

One minor note: the "For Freelancers and Variable Income" section (lines 71-81) is the longest sustained paragraph block in the article. It could benefit from a line break between the baseline concept (lines 73-77) and the two-things-it-does payoff (lines 79-81). This is a readability note, not a rhythm problem.

### Reframes Found

- **"A windfall isn't free money. It's a stewardship test with higher stakes and no monthly reset." (line 61)** -- This is the article's central reframe. It takes the reader's assumption (windfall = bonus, extra, fun money) and inverts it (windfall = a test of the habits you're building). The inversion is genuinely true and concise. It works.

- **"The baseline handles the fear. The windfall gets the freedom." (line 81)** -- A secondary reframe for the freelancer audience. Takes the assumption (variable income = constant anxiety) and inverts it (a baseline-plus-windfall framework converts anxiety into a clear system). Less dramatic than the primary reframe but effective for its audience.

### Engagement: Pulls forward

The opening scenario is one of the strongest in the Foundations series. The three-thought sequence (buy, save, guilt) creates immediate identification. "That feeling is the trap" earns the next section. "Why Windfalls Vanish" delivers on the promise. The article maintains curiosity through each section transition. The "Yes, Enjoy Some of It" section arrives at exactly the right moment -- after the reader has absorbed the framework, before the closing instruction. No section loses the reader.

### The "Changed Inside" Test

- **Reframe present:** Yes. "A windfall isn't free money. It's a stewardship test." This inverts the reader's assumption about bonus money.
- **Conclusion earned:** Mostly. The article builds toward the mantra restatement through scenarios, examples, and framework. The reader arrives at "Give first. Save second. Spend what remains. Every dollar." having understood why it applies to irregular income. The double closing (Change 4) slightly undermines the earned-ness by restating the conclusion twice.
- **Show vs. tell ratio:** Strong. The $3,000 bonus scenario (lines 13-17), the $2,400 tax refund evaporation (lines 33-34), and the allocation table (lines 51-55) are all concrete. The freelancer baseline method (line 75) is practical and specific. The article shows more than it tells.

### Condescension Check

- No "simply put," "let me explain," or "let's break this down" found.
- No over-explanation of obvious concepts.
- The reader is treated as an intelligent adult who has experienced the bonus-vanishing phenomenon and needs a framework, not a lecture.
- CLEAR.

---

## Truths Extracted

- **"There's no such thing as free money. Every dollar carries the same question: what do you want this to become?" (line 27)** -- Reframes the dollar from something you have to something you direct. Quotable independently. Could be used in onboarding copy for a windfall feature.

- **"The dollars that arrive without a plan are the ones most likely to disappear without a trace." (line 29)** -- Captures the central problem in a single sentence. Pull-quote or headline candidate.

- **"Not through bad decisions -- through the absence of a decision." (line 35)** -- Echoes a cross-series pattern (lifestyle creep, subscription creep, windfall vanishing all happen through absence of decision, not bad ones). Cross-article truth candidate.

- **"The dollars that arrive with a plan become building blocks. The ones that arrive without a plan become a story you can't quite piece together three months later." (line 99)** -- Strong closing truth. "Building blocks" vs. "a story you can't quite piece together" is vivid and memorable.

- **"That's the rhythm. Not restriction. Direction." (line 91)** -- Clean, quotable. Signature phrase candidate for the hierarchy across Storehouse content.

- **"The baseline handles the fear. The windfall gets the freedom." (line 81)** -- Tight two-sentence summary of the freelancer framework. Quotable for variable-income audiences.

---

## Cross-Reference Notes

- **Biblical attribution gap across the series:** Articles #1, #5, #8, and #11 all include at least one biblical reference (God, Joseph, Scripture, or specific verses). Article #10 includes none. A reader moving through the Foundations series would notice the inconsistency. This is the primary issue flagged in this review.

- **"Waterline" metaphor consistency:** Article #10 line 57 ("raises the waterline") and Article #9 line 31 ("let the water level rise one millimeter at a time") use the same image for spending expanding to absorb available money. Positive pattern. No action needed.

- **Lifestyle creep cross-reference:** Line 35 includes a named reference to "Lifestyle Creep: The Silent Margin Thief." This follows the series convention of naming companion articles explicitly.

- **Debt article cross-reference:** Line 69 includes "If you're in a season of debt payoff, 'Debt and the Hierarchy' shows how the hierarchy adjusts." This bridge connects the two audiences cleanly.

- **Allocation table format:** Lines 51-55 use the same Priority/Amount/Notes format as Articles #5 and #11. Consistent.

- **10% giving in context:** Article #5 line 17 presents 10% as the number that "makes your stomach tighten." Article #10 line 53 uses 10% in the allocation table example. The table is clearly labeled "An example" (line 49), which provides sufficient framing. The percentage range in line 47 ("maybe 5%, maybe 10%") is already softer than a single anchor. Minor tension but not a contradiction.

- **No contradictions found** across any cross-referenced articles.
