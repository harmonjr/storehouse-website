## Review Summary

A well-crafted Tier 2 Clarity article with an effective personal opening, a genuinely useful three-step process, and several quotable reframes. The "treasure hunt, not a diet" framing removes shame before the process even begins. The craft is strong: prose rhythm varies well, the table provides visual breathing room, and three genuine reframes are well-spaced throughout. The single most important issue is the biblical attribution gap -- "stewardship" appears as a concept throughout the piece (lines 88, 96, 100, 104, 120) but is now partially grounded at line 88, where the previous review's proposed change was implemented. However, this grounding uses the Integrity System's definition phrase without naming the Bible as the source. The updated CIS is more explicit: "When a principle comes from the Bible, say so. 'The Bible teaches...' and 'God's wisdom' are better than 'ancient wisdom' or 'faith traditions.'" One additional sentence would close this gap. Three proposed changes total -- one high-priority (complete the attribution), one medium (soften prescriptive tone), one low (clarify table context).

## Filter Questions

| # | Question | Result |
|---|----------|--------|
| 1 | Does this serve stewardship? | PASS -- The entire piece reclaims money leaving without active consent and channels it through the hierarchy. Line 96: "The subscription audit doesn't just find money. It gives you the chance to decide where it goes instead of letting it leak out unnoticed." |
| 2 | Which pillar does this serve? | PASS -- Primary: **Clarity** (making invisible charges visible). Secondary: **Margin** (reclaimed money becomes breathing room), **Order** (found money directed through the hierarchy, lines 88-96), **Peace** (closing frames seeing clearly as freedom, line 122). |
| 3 | Does this make the reader feel equipped and hopeful -- or guilty and overwhelmed? | PASS -- "Nobody is going to tell you to cancel Netflix and sit in the dark" (line 23). "You don't have to cancel anything right this second" (line 120). The "treasure hunt, not a diet" framing removes shame from the start. |
| 4 | Would Joseph recognize this wisdom? | PASS -- Seeing what is hidden and acting on it with foresight is Joseph's pattern exactly. The "Where the Found Money Goes" section channels reclaimed money into giving, saving, or intentional spending -- foresight, not hoarding. |
| 5 | Am I being honest -- or performative? | PASS -- The opening is concrete and personal ($73/month, three specific subscription types). Line 108 acknowledges this is ongoing: "New subscriptions accumulate. Free trials convert. Services raise their prices." No pretense of having arrived. |

## Voice Alignment

### Strong Moments

- **Lines 13-17:** "We found $73 a month in subscriptions we'd forgotten about. Not subscriptions we were using and decided to cancel. Subscriptions we didn't know we were paying for." Three specific, relatable examples follow. Kitchen-table storytelling at its best. The opening does exactly what the Craft Guide demands: drops you into a moment.

- **Lines 25-26:** "You signed up once. You stopped using the service. The charge continues. That's not a bill. That's a leak." Short, punchy, rhythmic. A genuine reframe delivered in five sentences. Pull-quote worthy.

- **Line 27:** "Reclaiming forgotten subscriptions feels like finding a $20 bill in your coat pocket -- except it's $50 or $100, and it shows up every single month." The coat-pocket analogy is warm, specific, and shifts the emotional register from cutting to finding.

- **Lines 53-55:** "Not 'do I use it sometimes?' Not 'might I need it eventually?' Would you, right now, hand over your credit card and sign up fresh?" Excellent practical writing -- the two disqualifying questions sharpen the real one. Gives the reader a tool, not a lecture.

- **Lines 80-81:** "No single charge feels worth the effort to cancel. Together, they're a car payment." The core insight of subscription creep in two sentences. Candidate truth.

### Deviations

- **Lines 88-89 (attribution gap):** The previous review's Change 1 was partially implemented. Line 88 now reads: "Stewardship -- the biblical idea that what we have isn't ours to consume but ours to manage faithfully -- means found money is an opportunity, not a windfall." This is progress: it connects stewardship to "the biblical idea." But the updated CIS now asks for more directness: "Say 'The Bible teaches...' not 'ancient wisdom.'" The phrase "the biblical idea" is closer to attribution than the previous version but still stops short of the CIS's updated standard. The Bible is described as the general source but no specific principle or passage is named. For a Tier 2 article, this is adequate but not exemplary. See Change 1 for a minor tightening.

- **Lines 57-58 (prescriptive tone):** "If no, cancel it. Today. Not next week. Not after you 'check one more time.'" This is the most prescriptive moment in the article. The surrounding text (lines 59-61) immediately softens with "every subscription you cancel can be restarted," but "Today. Not next week." edges toward the Storehouse voice boundary of "encouraging, not punishing." See Change 2.

## Anonymity Check

Not applicable -- Storehouse content does not have anonymity requirements.

## Factual Consistency

### Internal

- **$73 vs. $77.93 discrepancy:** The opening (line 13) says "We found $73 a month." The table (line 76) totals $77.93/month. The table is introduced on line 65 as "not our exact list, but representative of what we hear from others" -- this clarifying language was added from the previous review's Change 2. The distinction between the personal $73 and the illustrative $77.93 is now clear. Resolved.

- **$78 rounding:** Lines 84, 92, 94 round $77.93 to $78. Natural conversational rounding, not misleading.

- **Three months vs. thirty days:** Step 1 says "Pull three months" (line 35). The closing says "Just the last thirty days" (line 116). This is intentional -- the full audit vs. the quick-start action. Not contradictory.

### Cross-Content

- **Against "Give First" (Article #1):** Article #1 line 68 mentions "the subscription you forgot to cancel" as an example of spending crowding out giving. This article is the full treatment. The hierarchy language in "Where the Found Money Goes" correctly follows Give-Save-Spend order. Consistent.

- **Against "The Weekly Ritual" (Article #4):** Article #4 line 29 mentions noticing forgotten subscription charges during weekly import. This article's line 110 positions the weekly ritual as real-time catch, quarterly audit as deep clean. Complementary and consistent. The cross-reference phrasing "If you're doing the weekly import ritual" is conversational and appropriate.

- **Against "Lifestyle Creep" (Article #9):** Article #9 line 51 says "A subscription audit catches the charges you forgot about. Lifestyle creep is harder because you haven't forgotten anything." Correctly differentiates the two problems. Consistent.

- **Against "Where Does It Go" (Article #14):** Article #14 line 71 links to this article and describes subscriptions as "Charges so small and so automatic that they disappear from awareness entirely." Consistent with this article's framing of forgotten subscriptions as "leaks."

- **Against "The One Number" (Article #2):** No direct cross-reference, but the hierarchy formula and Safe-to-Spend concept are used consistently.

- **CIS subscription figure:** The CIS humor example says "$847/year." This article says $73/month ($876/year). Close but not identical. The CIS figure is illustrative, not canonical. Minor discrepancy, not blocking.

### Math

- Table math (lines 69-76): All monthly x 12 = annual calculations check out. Total correct.
- $78/month = $936/year (line 92): Correct.
- $936 x 3 = $2,808 (line 92): Correct.
- $200-300/month claim (line 3, description): Common statistic from C+R Research and West Monroe Partners. Reasonable.

## Red Lines Check

| Red Line | Status |
|----------|--------|
| Shaming people for financial situation | CLEAR -- "Nobody is going to tell you to cancel Netflix and sit in the dark" (line 23). Discovery tone throughout. |
| Prosperity gospel messaging | CLEAR -- No promises of wealth from giving. |
| Legalistic messaging | CLEAR -- "If you're at 3% and want to move toward 5%" (line 91) is conditional, not prescriptive. |
| Attacking competitors by name | CLEAR -- No competitor names. |
| Implying Storehouse replaces professional advice | CLEAR -- "You don't need the app to do what we did" (line 19). |
| Fear-based messaging | CLEAR -- "Treasure hunt" framing, no urgency language. |
| Excluding non-Christians | CLEAR -- Stewardship used in practical sense with biblical attribution. Accessible to any reader. |

No red line violations.

## Proposed Changes

### Change 1: Strengthen the biblical attribution with one more direct phrase

**Priority:** High
**Why:** Voice alignment -- "Attributive, not vague" (CIS). The current text at line 88 says "Stewardship -- the biblical idea that what we have isn't ours to consume but ours to manage faithfully -- means found money is an opportunity, not a windfall." This is good: it says "biblical idea." But the updated CIS asks for specificity: "Say 'The Bible teaches...' not 'ancient wisdom.'" The current phrasing names the Bible as a general source but doesn't cite a principle or passage. For a Tier 2 article that uses "stewardship" five times, one grounding moment should be more direct. The fix is small -- replace "the biblical idea" with a phrase that names the specific teaching.

> **Current (line 88):**
> The hierarchy offers a different path. Stewardship -- the biblical idea that what we have isn't ours to consume but ours to manage faithfully -- means found money is an opportunity, not a windfall.

> **Proposed:**
> The hierarchy offers a different path. The Bible teaches that what we have isn't ours to consume but ours to manage faithfully -- stewardship. Found money, then, is an opportunity, not a windfall.

This reorders the sentence to lead with "The Bible teaches," which is the CIS's preferred phrasing. "Stewardship" arrives as the name for the concept after the concept is grounded. The second sentence connects naturally. The change is five words of restructuring, not a new idea.

---

### Change 2: Soften the prescriptive "cancel it today" cadence

**Priority:** Medium
**Why:** Voice alignment / Guilt radar -- Lines 57-58 say "If no, cancel it. Today. Not next week. Not after you 'check one more time.'" This is the most prescriptive moment in the article. The Storehouse voice is "encouraging, not punishing" and "YNAB felt like a disappointed parent. Storehouse feels like a friend." The staccato "Today. Not next week." cadence sounds more like a command than an invitation. The surrounding text (lines 59-61) immediately softens with the "every subscription you cancel can be restarted" reassurance, which is excellent. But the damage is already done in the two-word sentences. The fix preserves the urgency (act now while you're paying attention) while removing the slightly scolding tone.

> **Current (lines 57-58):**
> If no, cancel it. Today. Not next week. Not after you "check one more time." The reason these charges persist is because canceling requires a decision and inertia doesn't. Make the decision now while you're looking at the number.

> **Proposed:**
> If no, cancel it. The reason these charges persist is because canceling requires a decision and inertia doesn't. Right now, while you're looking at the number, is the easiest moment to make that call.

This preserves the urgency ("right now, while you're looking at the number") but reframes it from "you must act now" to "now is the easiest moment" -- a Storehouse-voice move that empowers rather than commands. The reader still feels the push but doesn't feel scolded.

---

### Change 3: Verify the table introduction language (already addressed)

**Priority:** Low
**Why:** Factual consistency -- The previous review flagged the $73 vs. $77.93 proximity confusion. Line 65 now reads: "Here's what a typical forgotten-subscription haul might look like -- not our exact list, but representative of what we hear from others:" -- This clarifying language resolves the issue. The personal $73 story and the illustrative $77.93 table are properly distinguished.

**Status:** Already addressed. No further change needed.

## Craft Quality

### AI Tells Found

- **None significant.** This piece is remarkably clean of AI patterns. No hedge phrases, no filler transitions, no rule-of-three obsession, no symmetrical structure, no passive hedging. The one mild flag: "Before we go any further, let's get the framing right" (line 23) is a soft transition, but it reads naturally because the reframe it introduces (treasure hunt, not diet) genuinely needs setup before the process steps begin. Not flagging for revision.

**AI Tells Count: 0 actionable, 1 minor (noted only)**

### Prose Rhythm: Strong

The piece varies sentence length effectively throughout. The opening paragraph stacks three specific examples in a longer sentence, then punches with "Seventy-three dollars a month" (line 17, spelled out -- forces the reader to feel the number instead of skimming a digit). The three-step process section is clear and scannable. The table provides visual breathing room between prose-heavy sections. Short fragments ("That's a leak." "That's freedom.") land well against longer analytical sentences.

The one minor flat spot is lines 100-104, which run at a fairly uniform medium length. But this is a transitional passage connecting the audit to the broader philosophy, and the uniformity is not severe.

### Reframes Found

- **"This is a treasure hunt, not a diet." (line 21, section header)** -- Strong. Takes the reader's assumption (audit = deprivation) and inverts it. Well-placed before the process begins. Sets the emotional tone for the entire piece.

- **"That's not a bill. That's a leak." (lines 25-26)** -- Strong. Reframes forgotten subscriptions from passive obligation to active problem. Five short sentences, perfectly paced. Quotable.

- **"That's not austerity. That's freedom." (line 122)** -- Strong closer. Echoes the CIS's signature phrase ("The hierarchy isn't punishment. It's freedom.") while making it specific to the audit context.

**Reframe count: 3 strong. Well above the minimum. Well-spaced (beginning, middle, end).**

### Engagement: Pulls Forward

The opening drops you into a specific, relatable moment (finding $73 in forgotten subscriptions). The "treasure hunt" reframe shifts the emotional register. The three-step process is clear and actionable. The table provides a visual anchor. "Where the Found Money Goes" connects the practical audit to the hierarchy philosophy. The closing lowers the barrier from three months to thirty days. The reader never has a natural exit point until the end. Each section creates genuine curiosity for the next.

### The "Changed Inside" Test

The reader arrives believing: "I should probably audit my subscriptions" (obligation). The reader leaves believing: "I'm going on a treasure hunt" (excitement). The reframe from deprivation to discovery is the article's central craft achievement. The conclusion ("That's freedom") is earned through the journey -- the math, the table, the hierarchy application -- not stated upfront. Passes.

### Condescension Check: Clean

No "simply put," "let me explain," or "let's break this down." The reader is treated as a capable adult who can follow a three-step process. The "Would I sign up for this today?" test (line 51) gives the reader a tool rather than a lecture. The only borderline moment is lines 57-58 ("Today. Not next week.") which edges toward telling the reader what to do -- addressed in Change 2.

### Blame & Villainization Check: Clean

No adversarial framing. The "enemy" in this article is inertia and the auto-charge model ("The auto-charge model is designed to reduce friction -- for the company." line 102). This is a structural observation, not a character attack. No professionals vilified. No companies named. The critique targets the subscription business model, not the companies that use it. Fully compliant with the Competitor Respect Standard.

## Truths Extracted

- **"You signed up once. You stopped using the service. The charge continues. That's not a bill. That's a leak." (lines 25-26)** -- New truth candidate. Captures subscription creep in five short sentences. Quotable in marketing, onboarding, and subscription-detection features.

- **"No single charge feels worth the effort to cancel. Together, they're a car payment." (lines 80-81)** -- New truth candidate. The "car payment" comparison makes the abstract concrete. Strong for marketing.

- **"You can't steward what you can't see." (line 122)** -- Existing founding truth, well-deployed as the closing anchor.

- **"That's not austerity. That's freedom." (line 122)** -- Extension of the established signature phrase "The hierarchy isn't punishment. It's freedom." Applied to the specific context of the subscription audit.

- **"Would I sign up for this today?" (line 51)** -- Not a philosophical truth but a practical decision tool with broad applicability. Could be referenced in UI copy for subscription detection features.

---

## Cross-Reference Notes

- **Hierarchy language consistency:** The "Where the Found Money Goes" section (lines 88-96) correctly follows the Give-Save-Spend order from Article #1. It references "the hierarchy" by concept rather than article title, appropriate for a Tier 2 piece.

- **Weekly Ritual connection:** Line 110 positions the subscription audit as "deep clean" alongside the weekly ritual's real-time catch. Consistent with Article #4.

- **Lifestyle Creep complementarity:** Article #9 (line 51) correctly differentiates subscription creep (forgot about it) from lifestyle creep (actively using it, never decided to). The two articles are complementary without overlap.

- **Biblical attribution pattern:** The previous review's high-priority Change 1 was implemented -- line 88 now contains biblical attribution. The current review's Change 1 proposes a minor restructuring to better align with the updated CIS's preference for "The Bible teaches..." phrasing.

- **CIS subscription figure:** The CIS humor example says "$847/year." This article says $73/month ($876/year). Close but not identical. The CIS figure may reference an earlier audit or a different calculation. Minor, not blocking.

- **Author naming:** Frontmatter correctly shows `author: "JR"`. No "JR Harmon" or "Randy" in the editorial text. Compliant with updated CIS.

- **Feature Accuracy (CIS):** The article mentions "the subscription detector in Storehouse" (line 19) and "the weekly import ritual" (line 110). These align with the CIS's Feature Accuracy table: "weekly balance updates through manual import" (not "auto-connect / bank sync"). The subscription detector is described as something that was built ("We built the subscription detector"), not as a feature being sold. Appropriate.

- **Joseph Principle:** The updated CIS defines the Joseph Principle as "margin building for life's uncertainty." This article does not mention the Joseph Principle by name. It does not need to -- the article's focus is subscriptions and the audit process. No alignment issue.

## Cross-Link Recommendations

### Forward Links (this article -> existing)

The article currently has no outbound links to other Storehouse articles. Two opportunities:

| Target Article | Suggested Anchor Text | Section | Reason |
|---------------|----------------------|---------|--------|
| The Weekly Ritual | the weekly import ritual | Line 110 | Currently references the ritual by concept but doesn't link. A link here would help readers discover the companion practice. |
| Where Does It Go | perception gap | Lines 100-104 | The "You Can't Steward What You Can't See" section discusses making the invisible visible, which directly connects to the perception gap article. |

### Backlinks Needed (existing -> this article)

| Source Article | Suggested Anchor Text | Reason |
|---------------|----------------------|--------|
| Setting Your Hierarchy | The Subscription Audit | Already linked at line 73 of that article. No additional backlink needed. |
| Where Does It Go | Subscriptions | Already linked at line 71 of that article. |

One new forward link recommended (The Weekly Ritual). One optional forward link (Where Does It Go).
