# Content Review: The Subscription Audit: Finding Money You Forgot You Were Spending

**Source:** `projects/storehouse-website/src/content/foundations/the-subscription-audit.md`
**Reviewed:** 2026-02-14
**Reviewer:** content-reviewer agent
**Verdict:** PUBLISH_READY with minor revisions (4 medium-priority changes)

## Review Summary

This is a strong, practical article that delivers exactly what the Clarity pillar promises: making the invisible visible. The three-step audit process is concrete and actionable, the "treasure hunt, not a diet" reframe is effective, and the piece connects naturally to both the hierarchy and the Weekly Ritual. The voice is warm, conversational, and unmistakably Storehouse. At approximately 1,380 words (body text), it lands within the 800-1,500 range with room to spare. The four proposed changes are refinements -- tightening a redundancy, fixing a minor math inconsistency between the intro and the table, addressing a near-repetition of the founding truth, and softening one line that edges toward prescriptive territory. The piece is ready to publish after a light pass.

## Filter Questions

| # | Question | Result |
|---|----------|--------|
| 1 | Does this serve stewardship? | PASS -- The entire piece is about reclaiming money that is leaving without active consent and then directing it intentionally through the hierarchy. Line 98: "The subscription audit doesn't just find money. It gives you the chance to decide where it goes instead of letting it leak out unnoticed." That is stewardship in a sentence. The closing line (124) invokes the founding truth directly: "You can't steward what you can't see." |
| 2 | Which pillar does this serve? | PASS -- Primary: **Clarity** (line 6 frontmatter, and the article is structured around seeing what was hidden). The piece also serves **Margin** (reclaimed subscription money becomes breathing room, lines 84-98), **Order** (the "Where the Found Money Goes" section channels found money through the hierarchy, lines 90-97), and **Peace** (the closing frames seeing clearly as freedom, line 124). Serves all four pillars with Clarity dominant. |
| 3 | Does this make the reader feel equipped and hopeful -- or guilty and overwhelmed? | PASS -- The "treasure hunt, not a diet" framing (lines 21-29) actively removes shame from the start. Line 23: "Nobody is going to tell you to cancel Netflix and sit in the dark." The actionable step (lines 117-124) is gentle and low-pressure: "You don't have to cancel anything right this second." The closing is encouragement, not guilt: "That's not austerity. That's freedom." No guilt language anywhere. |
| 4 | Would Joseph recognize this wisdom? | PASS -- Joseph's stewardship was about seeing what others missed and acting on it with foresight. The subscription audit is the same move at a smaller scale: seeing charges that have been invisible and making an intentional decision about each one. The "Where the Found Money Goes" section (lines 84-98) channels the reclaimed money into giving, saving, or intentional spending -- foresight, not hoarding. Joseph would recognize this as prudent management. |
| 5 | Am I being honest -- or performative? | PASS -- The opening (lines 13-18) is concrete and personal: "We found $73 a month in subscriptions we'd forgotten about." The article names specific types of forgotten subscriptions (language app, cloud storage, streaming service) rather than speaking in abstractions. Line 110: "New subscriptions accumulate. Free trials convert. Services raise their prices." The piece acknowledges this is an ongoing challenge, not a one-time victory. Honest throughout. |

## Voice Alignment

### Hits (strong voice moments)

- **Lines 13-17:** "We found $73 a month in subscriptions we'd forgotten about. Not subscriptions we were using and decided to cancel. Subscriptions we didn't know we were paying for." -- The three specific examples (language app, cloud storage, streaming service) are exactly the kind of relatable, kitchen-table detail that defines Storehouse voice. This opening earns the reader's trust immediately.

- **Lines 25-26:** "You signed up once. You stopped using the service. The charge continues. That's not a bill. That's a leak." -- Short, punchy, rhythmic. The "bill vs. leak" distinction is a genuine reframe. This could be a pull quote.

- **Line 29:** "Reclaiming forgotten subscriptions feels like finding a $20 bill in your coat pocket -- except it's $50 or $100, and it shows up every single month." -- Perfect analogy. Warm, specific, and it shifts the emotional register from "cutting" to "finding."

- **Lines 53-55:** "Not 'do I use it sometimes?' Not 'might I need it eventually?' Would you, right now, hand over your credit card and sign up fresh?" -- This is excellent practical writing. The two disqualifying questions sharpen the real question. The reader can apply this immediately.

- **Line 82-83:** "No single charge feels worth the effort to cancel. Together, they're a car payment." -- The juxtaposition between individual insignificance and collective weight is the core insight of the piece, delivered in two sentences. Strong.

- **Lines 60-61:** "Here's why: every subscription you cancel can be restarted. If you cancel a streaming service and miss it two months later, sign up again." -- This addresses the reader's fear directly and disarms it. Warm, practical, no condescension.

### Misses (voice deviations)

- **Line 27:** "You're not cutting expenses. You're reclaiming money that was leaving without your permission." -- This line restates lines 25-26 almost verbatim. The "leak" metaphor already made this point more memorably. The repetition slightly dilutes the impact of the stronger version. See Change 1.

- **Line 102:** "Every financial principle in the world is useless if you don't know where your money is going." -- "Every financial principle in the world" is a sweeping generalization that edges toward the kind of bold-claim phrasing Storehouse typically avoids. The sentence works better with a lighter touch. See Change 3.

- **Line 112:** "If you've set up The Weekly Ritual from Article 4, you'll notice new subscriptions as they appear in your transaction imports." -- "from Article 4" breaks the fourth wall in a way no other article in the series does. The other cross-references use titles (e.g., Article #2 references "Give First, Save Second, Spend What Remains"; Article #5 references "The Subscription Audit" by concept). Referencing by article number feels like internal metadata, not a reader-facing reference. See Change 4.

## Anonymity Check

Not applicable -- Storehouse content does not have anonymity requirements.

## Factual Consistency

### Internal

- **$73 vs. $77.93 discrepancy:** The opening (line 13) says "We found $73 a month in subscriptions we'd forgotten about." The table on line 78 totals $77.93/month. The table appears to be a "typical" haul example, not the author's personal experience. But the proximity creates confusion -- the reader may assume the table is showing the $73 from the story, in which case the math does not match. The table's annual total of $935.16 is also not $876 (the annual figure from line 17, which is $73 x 12). Both examples are valid independently, but sitting next to each other they create a "which one is it?" moment. See Change 2.

- **$78 rounding:** Lines 86 and 92-96 round the $77.93 table total to $78. This is fine for conversational flow but should be consistent. The article uses both $77.93 (line 78) and $78 (lines 86, 92, 94, 96). The rounding is natural and not misleading.

- **Three months vs. thirty days:** Step 1 says "Pull three months of statements" (line 36). The "One Step You Can Take Today" section says "Just the last thirty days" (line 118). This is not a contradiction -- the full audit uses three months, while the quick-start action uses one month as a lower barrier. The distinction is clear and intentional.

### Cross-content

- **Against Article #5 ("Setting Your Hierarchy"):** Article #5 lines 71-78 directly foreshadow this article: "We'll talk more about this in 'The Subscription Audit,' but for now... make two lists: 1. Truly fixed. 2. Recurring but optional." Article #6 delivers on that promise. The "truly fixed vs. recurring but optional" distinction from Article #5 is not repeated verbatim in Article #6, but the "Would I sign up for this today?" test (line 53) serves the same function. Consistent.

- **Against Article #4 ("The Weekly Ritual"):** Article #4 line 29 says "You notice the charge from that subscription you forgot about." Article #6 line 112 references the Weekly Ritual as a real-time catch for new subscriptions. Consistent and complementary.

- **Against Article #1 ("Give First"):** Article #1 line 68 mentions "the subscription you forgot to cancel" as an example of spending that claims money before giving. Article #6 is the full treatment of that problem. The hierarchy language in Article #6's "Where the Found Money Goes" section (lines 90-97) correctly follows the Give-Save-Spend order from Article #1. Consistent.

- **Against Article #2 ("The One Number"):** Article #2 line 96 includes "fixed bills and subscriptions" in the Safe-to-Spend formula. Article #6 does not directly reference Safe-to-Spend by name until the "Where the Found Money Goes" section (line 96), where it correctly positions it as what remains after the hierarchy. Consistent.

- **Founding truth usage:** "You can't steward what you can't see" appears at line 100 (section heading), line 102, and line 122. It also appears in Article #2 line 99 and is listed as a founding truth in the Content Integrity System. The triple usage within one article is notable but each instance serves a different purpose (section heading, body context, closing). The closing usage (line 122) is the strongest. The section heading usage (line 100) is effective. The body usage at line 102 is the weakest and could be varied. See Change 3.

### Math/claims

- **"$200-300 in monthly subscriptions" (line 3, description):** This is a common statistic cited by multiple financial publications (C+R Research, West Monroe Partners). Reasonable claim for a description field.
- **Table math (lines 69-78):** All monthly-to-annual multiplications check out (monthly x 12 = annual). Total: $77.93/month, $935.16/year. Correct.
- **$936 savings projection (line 94):** "$78 a month is $936 a year" -- $78 x 12 = $936. Correct.
- **$2,808 three-year projection (line 94):** "$936 a year. In three years, that's $2,808." $936 x 3 = $2,808. Correct.

## Truth Extraction

Strong candidates from this piece:

- **"You signed up once. You stopped using the service. The charge continues. That's not a bill. That's a leak." (lines 25-26)** -- Quotable independently. Captures the core problem of subscription creep in five short sentences. Could be used in onboarding, marketing, and subscription-detection features.

- **"No single charge feels worth the effort to cancel. Together, they're a car payment." (lines 82-83)** -- New candidate truth. The "car payment" comparison makes the abstract concrete. Memorable and shareable.

- **"You can't steward what you can't see." (line 122)** -- Existing founding truth, well-deployed as the closing anchor. Already in the truth database.

- **"That's not austerity. That's freedom." (line 124)** -- Clean, two-beat closing. Echoes the Content Integrity System's signature phrase: "The hierarchy isn't punishment. It's freedom." Consistent extension of an established truth.

- **"Would I sign up for this today?" (line 53)** -- Not a truth in the philosophical sense, but a practical tool that could be referenced across the platform. It is a one-question decision framework with broad applicability.

## Red Lines Check

| Red Line | Status |
|----------|--------|
| Shaming people for their financial situation | CLEAR -- "This isn't about deprivation. Nobody is going to tell you to cancel Netflix and sit in the dark." (line 23) actively removes shame. The tone throughout is discovery, not accusation. |
| Prosperity gospel messaging | CLEAR -- No promises of wealth. Found money is directed toward the hierarchy, not toward abundance theology. |
| Legalistic messaging | CLEAR -- No mandatory percentages. Giving is mentioned as one option for found money: "If you're at 3% and want to move toward 5%..." (line 92) -- conditional, not prescriptive. |
| Attacking competitors by name | CLEAR -- No competitor names mentioned. |
| Implying Storehouse replaces professional financial advice | CLEAR -- Line 19: "You don't need the app to do what we did. You just need three months of bank statements and thirty minutes." The app is positioned as a tool, not a requirement. |
| Fear-based messaging | CLEAR -- No urgency language. No "you're running out of time." The tone is opportunity ("treasure hunt"), not alarm. |
| Excluding non-Christians from value proposition | CLEAR -- No faith language in the article body. "Stewardship" is used in its practical sense. The closing mentions stewardship without theological framing. Accessible to any reader. |

No red line violations.

## Proposed Changes

### Change 1: Remove redundant restatement after the "leak" metaphor

**Priority:** Medium
**Why:** Voice alignment -- Lines 25-26 deliver the "bill vs. leak" reframe with strong, punchy prose. Lines 27 restates the same idea in slightly weaker language. Removing the restatement lets the metaphor land harder.

> **Current (lines 25-27):**
> You signed up once. You stopped using the service. The charge continues. That's not a bill. That's a leak.
>
> You're not cutting expenses. You're reclaiming money that was leaving without your permission.

> **Proposed (lines 25-27):**
> You signed up once. You stopped using the service. The charge continues. That's not a bill. That's a leak.
>
> The difference matters. Cutting expenses feels like losing something. Reclaiming forgotten subscriptions feels like finding a $20 bill in your coat pocket...

This removes line 27 entirely and lets the existing transition at line 29 ("The difference matters...") follow directly from the "leak" metaphor. The paragraph starting "The difference matters" already does the work that line 27 attempts, and does it better.

---

### Change 2: Clarify the relationship between the personal $73 and the example table $77.93

**Priority:** Medium
**Why:** Factual consistency (internal) -- The reader encounters $73/month ($876/year) in the opening as a personal story, then a table totaling $77.93/month ($935.16/year) four paragraphs later. The proximity invites comparison, and the numbers do not match. Clarifying that the table is a separate, typical example prevents the reader from doing mental math and getting confused.

> **Current (lines 67-68):**
> Here's what a typical forgotten-subscription haul looks like:

> **Proposed (lines 67-68):**
> Here's what a typical forgotten-subscription haul might look like -- not our exact list, but representative of what we hear from others:

This small addition makes explicit that the table is illustrative, not a recounting of the $73 mentioned in the opening.

---

### Change 3: Vary the founding truth at line 102 to avoid triple-usage within one article

**Priority:** Medium
**Why:** Cross-content consistency / Voice alignment -- "You can't steward what you can't see" appears at line 100 (section heading), line 102 (body), and line 122 (closing). The section heading and closing are both strong placements. The body usage at line 102 is the weakest of the three and, combined with the sweeping "every financial principle in the world" claim, creates a paragraph that is slightly heavier than the rest of the article's tone.

> **Current (lines 100-102):**
> ## You Can't Steward What You Can't See
>
> This is the Clarity pillar at work. Every financial principle in the world is useless if you don't know where your money is going.

> **Proposed (lines 100-102):**
> ## You Can't Steward What You Can't See
>
> This is the Clarity pillar at work. The best financial intentions mean nothing if you don't know where your money is actually going.

This softens the sweeping claim to something more conversational and avoids restating the founding truth in the body when the section heading already carries it. The closing at line 122 retains the full founding truth for maximum impact.

---

### Change 4: Replace "Article 4" with the article's title

**Priority:** Medium
**Why:** Voice alignment / Cross-content consistency -- No other article in the series references a companion piece by number. All use titles or shorthand titles. "Article 4" reads like internal metadata rather than reader-facing prose.

> **Current (line 112):**
> If you've set up The Weekly Ritual from Article 4, you'll notice new subscriptions as they appear in your transaction imports.

> **Proposed (line 112):**
> If you've set up the weekly ritual we described in "The Weekly Ritual," you'll notice new subscriptions as they appear in your transaction imports.

Alternatively, a simpler version that avoids the slight awkwardness of naming the ritual and the article title:

> **Proposed (alternative):**
> If you're doing the weekly import ritual, you'll notice new subscriptions as they appear in your transaction reviews.

Either version removes the "Article 4" metadata. The alternative is more conversational; the first preserves the explicit cross-reference for readers navigating the series.

## Craft Observations (no Craft Guide exists -- informal notes)

**Prose rhythm:** Strong. The piece varies sentence length well throughout. The opening paragraph uses three specific examples in a longer sentence, followed by the short punch of lines 17-18. The three-step process section (lines 31-61) provides clear, scannable structure. The table (lines 69-78) gives visual breathing room between prose-heavy sections.

**Opening:** Earns the second paragraph. The specific dollar amount ($73) and the three concrete examples create immediate recognition. "Seventy-three dollars a month" (line 17, spelled out) is a smart choice -- it forces the reader to feel the number rather than skim past it.

**AI tells:** Very few. The piece avoids hedge phrases, filler transitions, and over-qualification. One minor flag: "Before we go any further, let's get the framing right" (line 23) is a mild throat-clearing transition, but it reads naturally in context because the reframe it introduces (treasure hunt, not diet) is genuinely needed before the process steps.

**Reframes present:** Yes. "Treasure hunt, not a diet" (line 21). "That's not a bill. That's a leak." (line 26). "That's not austerity. That's freedom." (line 124). Three genuine reframes, well-spaced throughout the piece.

**Show vs. tell ratio:** Good. The opening story (lines 13-18) shows the problem through personal experience. The table (lines 69-78) shows the math visually. The "Would I sign up for this today?" test (line 53) gives the reader a tool rather than a lecture.

**Engagement:** Pulls forward. Each section creates curiosity for the next: the opening problem leads to the reframe, the reframe leads to the process, the process leads to the math, the math leads to "where does this money go?" -- which connects to the hierarchy. The final section ("One Step You Can Take Today") appropriately lowers the barrier from the full three-month audit to a thirty-day scan.

## Cross-Reference Notes

- **Hierarchy reference in "Where the Found Money Goes" (lines 90-97):** This section correctly channels found money through the Give-Save-Spend order, matching Article #1. It references "the hierarchy" by concept, not by article title, which is appropriate for a Tier 2 piece that can assume the reader has encountered the hierarchy elsewhere.

- **"Setting Your Hierarchy" foreshadowing fulfilled:** Article #5 (line 73) promised "We'll talk more about this in 'The Subscription Audit.'" Article #6 delivers on that promise with a full treatment of recurring-but-optional charges. The two articles are complementary and consistent.

- **Weekly Ritual connection (lines 110-114):** The positioning of the subscription audit as a "deep clean" alongside the weekly ritual's "real-time catch" is effective and consistent with Article #4's framing. Article #4 (line 29) mentions noticing forgotten subscriptions during the weekly import. Article #6 extends that into a full quarterly process. No contradictions.

- **Founding truth "You can't steward what you can't see":** Used in this article at lines 100, 102, and 122. Also appears in Article #2 (line 99). The triple usage within this article is the only concern -- see Change 3 above. The closing placement (line 122) is the strongest across all articles that use this truth.

- **No contradictions found** across any of the five cross-reference articles.

- **Subscription detector mention (line 19):** "We built the subscription detector in Storehouse because of that moment." This is consistent with the Content Integrity System's humor example (line 127): "We built the subscription detector because we found $847/year in services we forgot we had." Note: the CIS says $847/year; the article says $73/month ($876/year). These are close but not identical. The CIS figure may refer to an earlier version of the story. Minor discrepancy worth noting but not blocking -- the CIS example is illustrative, not canonical, and $876 vs. $847 are both plausible real figures from different audit rounds.
