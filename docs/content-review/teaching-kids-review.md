## Review Summary

This is the most emotionally resonant piece in the blog collection. The opening -- "Nobody taught you the hierarchy" -- is a hook that names something the reader has felt but never articulated. The article builds from that void to a vision of what's possible: children who grow up inside the practice rather than discovering it as adults. The writing is warm without being sentimental, practical without being clinical, and biblically grounded without being preachy. The Joseph reference (line 76) is well-placed, credits God, and uses "seasons" language implicitly. The piece serves the Peace pillar powerfully -- the image of a home where money isn't a source of anxiety is the article's real gift. Two issues: (1) missing author frontmatter field, and (2) one instance where the categories language doesn't match the updated CIS (line 36 says "four lines" including "Safe-to-Spend" as if it's a category, when it's the result of the hierarchy, not a tier). Both are minor. This article is close to publish-ready.

## Filter Questions

| # | Question | Result |
|---|----------|--------|
| 1 | Does this serve stewardship? | PASS -- The entire article is about passing stewardship to the next generation. Line 76: "stewardship isn't about being rich or poor. It's about being intentional with whatever you have." The hierarchy is framed as a practice to be absorbed, not a rule to be imposed. |
| 2 | Which pillar does this serve? | PASS -- Primary: Peace (a home where money isn't anxiety-producing). Secondary: Order (teaching the hierarchy to children). Also touches Clarity (making the invisible visible to kids). |
| 3 | Does this make the reader feel equipped and hopeful -- or guilty and overwhelmed? | PASS -- The article never implies parents should already be doing this. Line 15: "You had to find a different way on your own." The tone is: it's not too late. The closing step (line 92) is remarkably low-barrier: "tell your kids one thing about how your family handles money. Not a lecture. A sentence." |
| 4 | Would Joseph recognize this wisdom? | PASS -- Line 76: "God gave Joseph wisdom to store grain during abundance so Egypt could survive famine. Your kids can learn the same posture -- not because you lectured them about a Bible story, but because they watched you live it out on a Tuesday." God is credited, the story is applied practically, and the "lived out on a Tuesday" detail grounds it in the ordinary. |
| 5 | Am I being honest -- or performative? | PASS -- Line 12: "They teach restraint without teaching order. They teach caution without teaching purpose." This is an honest assessment of the financial advice most parents received. The article doesn't pretend the hierarchy is easy or that kids will immediately understand it. |

## Proposed Changes

### Change 1: Missing author field in frontmatter

**Priority:** Medium
**Why:** Author Naming (CIS). The CIS specifies the author is "JR" only. The frontmatter lacks an author field.

> **Current (lines 1-6):**
> ---
> title: "Teaching Your Kids What Nobody Taught You"
> description: "The most powerful money lesson isn't a curriculum. It's a household that practices what it believes."
> publishDate: 2026-02-12
> category: "faith-stewardship"
> ---

> **Proposed:**

> category: "faith-stewardship"

### Change 2: "Four lines" framing treats Safe-to-Spend as a hierarchy tier

**Priority:** Medium
**Why:** Feature Accuracy (CIS). Line 36 describes the fridge chart as "Four lines: Give, Save, Bills, Safe-to-Spend." This treats Safe-to-Spend as a fourth tier alongside Give, Save, and Bills. But Safe-to-Spend is the result of the hierarchy -- what remains after the tiers are handled. The CIS defines the hierarchy as "Give, Save, Bills, Live" and Safe-to-Spend as "one number after priorities are handled." Listing Safe-to-Spend as a peer of Give/Save/Bills conflates the tiers with the result.

> **Current (line 36):**
> Four lines: Give, Save, Bills, Safe-to-Spend. The kids don't need to know the exact numbers (though older kids might be ready for that). They need to see the order.

> **Proposed:**
> Four lines: Give, Save, Bills, Live. The kids don't need to know the exact numbers (though older kids might be ready for that). They need to see the order. They need to see that what's left for spending -- Safe-to-Spend -- comes only after giving, saving, and bills are handled.

This separates the hierarchy tiers (Give, Save, Bills, Live) from the result (Safe-to-Spend) while keeping both concepts visible. The fridge chart should show the hierarchy order, not the calculation output.

### Change 3: "Firstfruits" reference on line 74 -- verify alignment with CIS attribution standard

**Priority:** Low
**Why:** Biblical Attribution Standard (Craft Guide). Line 74 says: "the Bible calls it firstfruits because what you give first reveals what you value most." This is a good attribution -- it names the Bible, uses the concept naturally, and connects it to a practical insight. However, the Craft Guide's attribution examples suggest weaving the citation in with more context: "There's a principle in Proverbs -- honor God with the first of what you earn." The current line is fine as-is, but could be enriched.

> **Current (line 74):**
> the Bible calls it firstfruits because what you give first reveals what you value most

> **Proposed:**
> No change needed. The current attribution is natural, accurate, and non-preachy. It names the source and connects the principle to the article's theme. One of the better biblical references in the collection.

---

### Change 4: "The chart on the fridge" repeated three times

**Priority:** Low
**Why:** Prose rhythm. "The chart on the fridge" or "chart on the refrigerator" appears on lines 34, 54, and 82. The first two instances (establishing and referencing the concept) are fine. The third (line 82) is part of the Long Game section's emotional callback and works as intentional repetition -- it creates a thread running through the article. Noting for awareness only. The repetition is purposeful and effective here, not a craft issue.

> **Proposed:**
> No change needed. The repetition is a structural choice that works.

## Craft Quality

### AI Tells Found
- **Symmetrical age-bracket structure (lines 56-60):** Three age groups with matching bold-header format (Young children, Older children, Teenagers). This is a natural organizational choice for age-based advice and is not an AI tell -- it's just good structure. The content within each bracket varies in length and specificity, which prevents monotony.
- No significant AI tells detected. The piece reads as genuinely experienced. The specific details ("the Sunday morning review," "the jars on the shelf," "a Tuesday") signal memory, not generation.

**AI Tells Count: 0 actionable**

### Prose Rhythm: Strong

The opening uses deliberate repetition -- "Nobody taught you... Nobody sat you down... Nobody showed you" -- to build emotional weight before the pivot. The fragments "They teach restraint without teaching order. They teach caution without teaching purpose." (line 12) create a rhythmic pattern that feels like reckoning. The "Visibility Principle" section shifts to a more practical register with clear, shorter sentences. The age-bracket section is scannable and practical -- a rest stop after the emotional opening sections.

The strongest prose moment is the Long Game section (lines 79-88). The list of memories -- "The chart on the fridge. The Sunday morning review. The jars on the shelf. The calm tone when an unexpected expense appeared." -- builds through accumulation, each fragment shorter than the last, until the emotional climax: "They'll remember that money wasn't a source of anxiety in their home." The writing earns this moment.

### Reframes Found
- "They teach restraint without teaching order. They teach caution without teaching purpose." (line 12) -- Takes familiar childhood financial advice ("Save your allowance," "Don't spend it all") and reframes it as incomplete. The reader has heard these phrases their entire life and never questioned what was missing.
- "The most powerful financial education isn't something you teach. It's something they absorb." (line 26) -- Reframes financial education from curriculum to environment. Takes the reader's assumption (I need to teach my kids about money) and inverts it (I need to practice it where they can see it).
- "Instead of discovering the hierarchy as a corrective, they'll carry it as a foundation." (line 86) -- Reframes the reader's own experience (the hierarchy as a fix for adult problems) as something their children could experience differently (the hierarchy as a starting point).

**Reframe count: 3 strong. All earned and well-placed.**

### Engagement: Pulls forward

"Nobody taught you the hierarchy" stops the reader. The next two paragraphs build the void -- what the reader did get (fragments, cliches, spending-first thinking disguised as wisdom). "You can spare your kids that unlearning" (line 16) is the pivot that creates the article's forward momentum: how? The Visibility Principle provides the mechanism. The age brackets make it actionable. The Long Game section provides the emotional payoff. The closing step is so simple it feels inevitable.

## The "Changed Inside" Test

The reader arrives believing: "I need to teach my kids about money (and I don't know how)." The reader leaves believing: "I need to practice the hierarchy visibly, and my kids will absorb it." The shift from teaching to practicing is the article's central reframe, and it's genuinely relieving -- it takes the pressure off creating a financial literacy curriculum and replaces it with something the reader is already doing (or could easily start). Passes.

## Condescension Check: Clean

No "simply put," "let me explain," or "let's break this down." The article treats the reader as a parent who cares deeply about their children's future and is doing their best with what they were given. Line 15: "You had to find a different way on your own" is empathetic, not condescending. The age-bracket section gives practical guidance without over-explaining.

## Blame & Villainization Check: Clean

The article critiques the financial education most parents received without blaming anyone: "Nobody taught you the hierarchy" names a gap without assigning fault. The childhood cliches ("Save your allowance," "Don't spend it all in one place") are described as "not wrong, exactly. They're just incomplete." (line 12). This is generous and accurate -- it honors the intention while naming the limitation.

## Red Lines Check

| Red Line | Status |
|----------|--------|
| Shaming people for financial situation | CLEAR -- "You had to find a different way on your own" validates rather than shames |
| Prosperity gospel messaging | CLEAR |
| Legalistic messaging | CLEAR -- "the Bible calls it firstfruits" is attributive, not prescriptive. No mandatory percentages for children. |
| Attacking other apps by name | CLEAR -- No competitors mentioned |
| Replacing professional financial advice | CLEAR |
| Fear-based messaging | CLEAR -- The Long Game section emphasizes hope, not fear about children's futures |
| Excluding non-Christians | CLEAR -- The hierarchy is practiced as a family value; the biblical source is named but not required for the advice to work |

No red line violations.

## Truths Extracted

- "Nobody taught you the hierarchy." (line 8) -- Five words that name a universal experience. The simplicity is its power. Strong candidate for marketing and social content.
- "The most powerful financial education isn't something you teach. It's something they absorb." (line 26) -- Quotable independently. Challenges the assumption that financial literacy is a curriculum.
- "They teach restraint without teaching order. They teach caution without teaching purpose." (line 12) -- Describes the gap between common financial advice and the hierarchy. Tightly constructed, memorable.
- "That's a different kind of inheritance. Not a balance in an account, but a practice in the bones." (line 88) -- The article's emotional capstone. Redefines inheritance from financial to formational.

## Cross-Reference Notes

### Consistency with Give First, Save Second, Spend What Remains
The hierarchy language is consistent: Give, Save, Bills, Live. The foundations article establishes the order; this blog post applies it to family practice. No contradictions.

### Consistency with The Weekly Ritual
Line 64 references "the weekly import ritual -- the ten minutes on Sunday morning with the coffee and the transactions." This is consistent with The Weekly Ritual's description. "Ten minutes" is used consistently across both articles.

### Safe-to-Spend as hierarchy tier (NOTED)
Line 36 lists "Give, Save, Bills, Safe-to-Spend" as four lines on a fridge chart. Other articles and the CIS consistently use "Give, Save, Bills, Live" as the four hierarchy tiers, with Safe-to-Spend as the resulting number. This article conflates the tier label ("Live") with the output ("Safe-to-Spend"). Change 2 addresses this.

### Joseph reference
Line 76: "God gave Joseph wisdom to store grain during abundance so Egypt could survive famine." This credits God as the source and uses the story naturally. The sentence continues: "not because you lectured them about a Bible story, but because they watched you live it out on a Tuesday." This is one of the best Joseph references in the collection -- it connects the biblical story to the ordinary without making it feel forced.

### Blog format appropriateness
This article was moved from Foundations to Blog. At ~1,350 words, it's comfortably within the blog range (800-1,500). The tone is warmer and more personal than most foundations articles, which makes it a natural fit for the blog. The faith-stewardship category is appropriate -- this is the most explicitly values-oriented piece in the blog collection.

### Frontmatter consistency
Missing `author` field. The `category: "faith-stewardship"` is specific and appropriate for this piece.

## Cross-Link Recommendations

### Forward Links (this article to existing)
| Target Article | Suggested Anchor Text | Section | Reason |
|---------------|----------------------|---------|--------|
| Give First, Save Second, Spend What Remains | "the hierarchy" or "Give First" | What You're Actually Teaching | The hierarchy is named repeatedly but never linked to the foundational article that explains it |
| The Weekly Ritual | "weekly import ritual" | The Weekly Review as Family Practice | Line 64 describes the ritual but doesn't link to the full article |
| Setting Your Hierarchy | "setting your hierarchy" | The Visibility Principle | Parents who want to show the fridge chart need to know how to set the hierarchy themselves first |

### Backlinks Needed (existing to this article)
| Source Article | Suggested Anchor Text | Reason |
|---------------|----------------------|--------|
| The Money Conversation | "teaching your kids" | The Money Conversation is about couples; linking to the kids article extends the family theme |
| Give First, Save Second, Spend What Remains | "what it looks like in a household" | The foundational article about the hierarchy would benefit from linking to this practical family application |
