# Storehouse: Content Craft Guide

## The Craft Standard

The Content Integrity System asks: *Does this help someone become a better steward?* This guide asks a different question: **Does this make someone feel like they can actually do it?**

Good financial advice is everywhere. What separates Storehouse is writing that meets people in their anxiety and walks them toward clarity. Every piece should have at least one moment where the reader stops managing their fear and starts managing their money.

The bar is not "accurate and helpful." The bar is: someone who has been avoiding their bank account reads this and opens the app.

## AI Tells -- The Watchlist

AI-generated content has a fingerprint. It is fluent, grammatical, and utterly forgettable. These are the specific patterns to flag and fix.

### Hedge Phrases

Throat-clearing that adds nothing. The writer is stalling instead of saying the thing.

> **Bad:** "It's important to note that most families spend more than they realize on subscriptions."
>
> **Better:** "Most families spend more than they realize on subscriptions."

> **Bad:** "It's worth mentioning that the order you spend and save in actually matters."
>
> **Better:** "The order matters. Give first, save second, spend what remains. Flip that sequence and everything falls apart."

The fix is almost always deletion. Say the thing. Trust the reader to recognize its importance.

### Filler Transitions

Phrases that signal a transition without actually creating one.

> **Bad:** "With that said, let's dive into why the hierarchy works."
>
> **Better:** Just start the next section. If the transition feels abrupt, the problem is structural -- the sections aren't connected logically. No phrase will fix that.

Kill on sight: "Let's dive in," "furthermore," "moreover," "at the end of the day," "without further ado," "with that being said," "in today's economy," "in this article we'll explore."

### The Rule of Three Obsession

AI defaults to three parallel items with matching structure. Three benefits. Three risks. Three reasons. Always three, always symmetrical.

> **Bad:** "The hierarchy gives you three things: clarity about your spending, confidence in your decisions, and peace about your future."
>
> **Better:** "The hierarchy means your giving happens before your spending has a chance to crowd it out. That one shift changes everything."

One strong point beats three tidy ones. And when you do list multiple things, vary the count. Two items. Five. Seven. The world is not organized in threes.

### "It's Not X, It's Y" as Primary Device

A useful rhetorical move that AI leans on until it becomes wallpaper. Use it once, powerfully, then find other structures. "Safe-to-Spend isn't a budget. It's a daily answer to 'Can we afford this?'" -- that works because it appears once and reframes something real.

### Symmetrical Structure

Every section the same length. Every paragraph four sentences. Every argument in three parts. This is the layout of content, not writing.

Real writing breathes. One section runs long because the idea demands it. The next is two sentences because that is all it needs. A paragraph can be one line.

It can.

### Neat Conclusions

AI wraps everything up. Every section resolves. Every article ends with a bow. Real life has rough edges, and writing that acknowledges them earns more trust than writing that smooths them over.

> **Bad:** "By following the hierarchy, you'll be well on your way to financial peace and faithful stewardship."
>
> **Better:** "We're still figuring this out too. Some months the giving happens first. Some months it doesn't. The hierarchy isn't a standard we've met. It's a direction we keep walking."

### Abstract Over Specific

AI reaches for the general. Strong writing reaches for the particular.

> **Bad:** "Many families find themselves struggling to save consistently amid rising costs."
>
> **Better:** "We found $847 a year in subscriptions we forgot we had. Not gym memberships and streaming services we were ignoring. Services we genuinely did not know we were paying for."

### Passive Hedging

Distancing the writer from their own argument.

> **Bad:** "It could be argued that most budgeting approaches ask too much of the user."
>
> **Better:** "Most budgeting approaches ask too much. Categorize every dollar. Review every transaction. Reconcile every week. That's a second job, not a budget."

If you believe it, say it. If you don't believe it, don't include it.

### Over-Qualification

> **Bad:** "While every family's situation is different and there are certainly valid approaches that prioritize paying off debt first, for many households, establishing a giving practice early may potentially create a stronger foundation for long-term financial health."
>
> **Better:** "Start giving before you feel ready. The amount doesn't matter. The order does."

Qualification has its place -- honest writing acknowledges nuance. But when every sentence has an escape hatch, the writing communicates nothing.

### Emotional Flatness

Describing feelings instead of evoking them.

> **Bad:** "Many couples experience stress and tension when discussing finances."
>
> **Better:** "The question was 'Should we get the kids new shoes this week?' What I heard was 'You're failing us.' That's what money fights sound like from the inside."

---

## Prose Rhythm

Gary Provost said it best:

> "This sentence has five words. Here are five more words. Five-word sentences are fine. But several together become monotonous. Listen to what is happening. The writing is getting boring. The sound of it drones. It's like a stuck record. The ear demands some variety. Now listen. I vary the sentence length, and I create music. Music. The writing sings. It has a pleasant rhythm, a lilt, a harmony."

### How to Detect Monotony

Read the draft aloud. If you can predict the rhythm of the next sentence before you read it, the writing is monotonous. Your ear knows before your brain does.

### The Short Sentence After the Long One

A long sentence builds complexity, stacks clauses, carries the reader through the monthly rhythm of paycheck to bills to groceries to the slow realization that there is nothing left for the thing that matters most. Then you stop.

That stop is where the meaning lands. "But we gave first." Four words after a paragraph of mounting pressure. That is the craft.

### Fragments as Emphasis

Not every sentence needs a verb. "Every dollar." "Before the month begins." "Just one number." Fragments work because they break the pattern. Use them sparingly -- like seasoning, not the main dish.

### Paragraph Length Variation

A paragraph can be a single sentence that needs to stand alone.

It can also be a longer passage that builds an argument across several sentences, layering the math, adding the emotional weight, and arriving at an insight that would feel too abrupt without the groundwork. Both are valid. Alternating between them creates visual and cognitive rhythm on the page.

## The Engagement Test

### Does the First Sentence Earn the Second?

The opening line is not a summary. It is a hook. Compare:

> **Weak:** "In this article, we'll explore why giving first changes your relationship with money."
>
> **Strong:** "We were $200 short on rent the month we started tithing. That's not the setup for a story about failure."

The strong opening drops you into a moment. You need to know what happens next. The weak opening describes what will happen from the outside.

### Do Sections Create Curiosity for the Next?

Each section should leave a thread unresolved. Not a cliffhanger -- a genuine question the reader now wants answered. "What the Numbers Actually Show" as a header after a story about financial anxiety works because by then you need to see whether the hierarchy holds up under real math.

### Is Something at Risk?

Stakes drive reading. In a piece about the Give-Save-Spend hierarchy, the stakes are the reader's most deeply held values reflected in their bank statement. Even in practical how-to content, something must be at risk -- the reader's assumptions, their peace of mind, their marriage's next money conversation.

### Is There at Least One Surprise?

The reader came in believing something. Does the piece subvert it? Showing that a family giving 10% and saving 15% actually had more discretionary freedom than a family keeping everything -- that is a surprise. The reader expected generosity to cost something. The reframe shows it creating something.

### Are Dense Sections Followed by Breathing Room?

After a section with math and percentages, the writing should open up into reflection or story. After a heavy emotional passage, a concrete step or example lets the reader pause. Dense content needs a rest stop.

## The Condescension Radar

Storehouse respects its readers. These patterns undermine that respect.

**"Simply put" and "In other words" after clear statements.** If the statement was clear, restating it implies the reader missed it. If it was not clear, rewrite the original instead of patching it.

**"Let me explain" and "Let's break this down."** These phrases position the writer as teacher and the reader as student. Storehouse's voice is a friend at the kitchen table, not a financial advisor behind a desk. Just explain. The reader will follow.

**Treating adults like they have never thought about money.** The readers are not financially illiterate. They are navigating a system designed to extract every dollar before they can be intentional with it. There is a difference between "you don't understand budgeting" and "the system isn't designed to help you budget." The first condescends. The second empowers.

**Assuming universal financial knowledge.** This is the flip side. Don't assume everyone knows what a 401(k) match is, how compound interest works, or what "pre-tax" means. The solution is not a glossary or a parenthetical lecture. It is writing that explains by showing. "Your employer matches your 401(k) contribution -- meaning for every dollar you put in, they add a dollar. It's free money you lose by not participating." That is explanation without condescension.

**The line between accessible and condescending.** Clear language is good. Short sentences are good. Defining jargon when it first appears is good. None of that is dumbing down. Dumbing down is when you simplify the idea, not the language. Explain complex things clearly; do not replace them with simple things.

## The Competitor Respect Standard

Storehouse differentiates on approach, not by attacking products. A YNAB user reading Storehouse content should feel invited, not insulted. A Mint refugee should feel understood, not recruited.

### The Principle

Critique the **approach** (envelope budgeting, zero-based budgeting, passive tracking, category overload), not the **product** or the **people** who use it. Most budgeting apps were built by people who genuinely want to help. The question is whether the approach itself serves the user well over time.

### Substitution Table

| Don't Write | Write Instead |
|-------------|---------------|
| "YNAB makes you feel guilty" | "Zero-based budgeting can feel like a disappointed parent -- every unassigned dollar is a failure" |
| "Other apps are too complicated" | "Most budgeting approaches ask you to categorize every dollar. That's a lot of decisions before you've made any progress." |
| "Mint doesn't work" | "Passive tracking shows you what happened but doesn't help you decide what to do next" |
| "Envelope budgeting is outdated" | "Envelope budgeting was designed for a world where cash was king. When everything is a swipe, the metaphor breaks down." |
| "Those apps don't get it" | "Most budgeting tools start with spending. We start with giving. That one difference changes the entire experience." |
| "You wasted time with other apps" | "If another approach worked for you, that's great. If it didn't, you're not the problem." |

### Structural Observation, Not Character Judgment

> **Bad:** "YNAB's creators care more about methodology than user experience."
>
> **Better:** "Zero-based budgeting is philosophically thorough. Every dollar gets a job. But for many people, that thoroughness becomes a burden -- and the budget gets abandoned by February."

### The Test

Read every sentence about other apps or approaches as if a loyal, satisfied user of that product is reading it. If they would feel attacked rather than understood, rewrite. They might be your next user -- but only if you respected them first.

## Show vs. Tell

### Stories Over Statements

> **Telling:** "Following the hierarchy brings peace."
>
> **Showing:** "The first month we gave first, I checked the bank account expecting disaster. Instead I found $340 left over. Not because we earned more. Because we spent less when giving came first."

The statement is forgettable. The story is not. One specific, vivid example does more work than three paragraphs of general claims.

### Specific Numbers Over Vague Quantities

"A lot of subscriptions" is forgettable. "$847/year" is concrete. "Some savings" disappears. "$240 in a jar on the counter, separated before the bills came" sticks. Numbers ground abstract ideas in reality. Use them.

### Let the Reader Draw the Conclusion

> **Telling:** "This shows that giving first actually creates margin."
>
> **Earning:** Walk the reader through the month. Show the paycheck. Show the tithe going out on the first. Show the automatic savings transfer on the second. Show the bills. Show what remains. Show that it is more than they expected -- and never once say "giving creates margin." The reader arrives there on their own, and the insight sticks because they built it.

---

## The "Changed Inside" Test

Every piece needs at least one **reframe** -- a sentence that takes something the reader believes and inverts it.

> "You don't budget to restrict yourself. You budget so your money stops making decisions for you."

This works because it takes a familiar feeling (budgeting as restriction) and reveals its opposite (budgeting as freedom). The reader thought a budget was a cage. After the reframe, they see it as a key.

> "Most people spend first, save what's left, and give if there's extra. Flip the order and everything changes."

Same structure. Take the assumption (the cultural default order), flip it (the hierarchy). The reader has always known the order they follow. They never questioned it.

### What Makes a Reframe Work

1. **It starts with something the reader already believes.** You cannot invert an assumption the reader does not hold.
2. **The inversion is genuinely true.** Clever-but-false reframes erode trust. The insight must survive scrutiny.
3. **It is concise.** Reframes lose power with every additional word. Two sentences maximum.
4. **It appears once.** A reframe used three times in one article becomes a gimmick.

## Earned Conclusions

The difference between content and craft:

> **Content approach:** "The hierarchy works. Here's why." Then a list of reasons.
>
> **Craft approach:** Walk someone through their actual month. Show the paycheck. Show what happens when spending goes first -- the guilt when giving gets the scraps, the stress when savings stays at zero. Then show the same paycheck with the order flipped. Let them see the math. Let them feel the difference. Never say "the hierarchy works." They already know.

The journey is the argument. If you state the conclusion at the top, the reader has no reason to keep reading. If you build toward it, the reader arrives at the insight alongside you -- and it feels like their own discovery, not your lecture.

This is especially important for Storehouse articles, which are shorter (800-1,500 words). The temptation to state the conclusion early is higher when you have fewer words. Resist it. A shorter piece that earns its conclusion is more powerful than a longer one that announces it.

---

## The Voice of Experience

What separates "content" from writing that feels lived:

**Specific, grounded details.** Not "many families struggle with saving" but "$847 in forgotten subscriptions" and "the money fight about new shoes." Details signal memory. Memory signals experience. Experience signals trust.

**Admissions of uncertainty or failure.** "Some months the giving happens first. Some months it doesn't. We built this app because we needed the guardrail as much as anyone." This admission does more for credibility than any credential could.

**Opinions stated as opinions.** "This bothers me." Not "it could be argued that this is concerning." Own the feeling. The reader came for a human perspective, not a balanced briefing.

**The confidence to say something countercultural.** "Give first, even when you're behind" is a countercultural claim in a world that says secure your own oxygen mask first. The writing does not apologize for this position. It makes the case and lets the reader decide.

---

## The Biblical Attribution Standard

Storehouse is built on biblical stewardship. When and how we cite Scripture matters.

### When to Cite

- **Cite** when the principle originates from a specific passage. The firstfruits concept comes from Proverbs 3:9 -- say so.
- **Cite** when retelling or referencing a biblical story directly. Joseph and the storehouse (Genesis 41) deserves attribution.
- **Don't cite** for every sentence. This is not a Bible study. One or two citations per article is the sweet spot.
- **Don't cite** for general principles that happen to align with Scripture. "Live below your means" does not need a verse reference.

### How to Cite

Weave naturally into the text. Not as academic footnotes. Not as proof-texts.

> **Bad:** "We should give first (Proverbs 3:9, NIV: 'Honor the Lord with your wealth, with the firstfruits of all your crops')."
>
> **Better:** "There's a principle in Proverbs -- honor God with the first of what you earn, not the leftovers. The writer called it firstfruits. We call it the hierarchy."

> **Bad:** "Genesis 41:35-36 says we should save during abundance for times of scarcity."
>
> **Better:** "Joseph told Pharaoh to store grain during the seven good years so Egypt could survive the seven bad ones. That's not ancient history. That's a savings rate."

### The Posture

- Scripture as **invitation**, never as weapon. "The Bible describes a principle that changes everything" -- not "The Bible says you MUST."
- When retelling biblical stories, credit God as the source of wisdom, not just the human character. Joseph had a plan because God gave him insight. The storehouse worked because it was God's idea, executed by a faithful steward.
- Never imply that non-Christians cannot benefit from the principles. The hierarchy works whether you follow it for faith reasons or purely practical ones. The biblical foundation is our *why*, not the user's requirement.

## The Guilt Radar

Finance content drifts toward shame more easily than any other genre. This is the most important quality check for Storehouse content.

### Flags to Watch For

- **"You should be..."** -- Prescriptive guilt. Replace with "Here's what it looks like when..." or "One approach that works..."
- **"If you just..."** -- Implies the problem is simple and the reader is lazy. The problem is almost never simple.
- **"Most people fail at..."** -- The reader assumes they are most people. Reframe: "Most approaches fail people" or "The system isn't set up for this."
- **Unrealistic baselines.** "If you save $500/month..." is a fantasy for a family living paycheck to paycheck. Start with $25. Start with $5. Start with moving one dollar into a jar before you pay anything else. That is the hierarchy in action.
- **Before-and-after stories that skip the middle.** "We were in debt, then we followed the hierarchy, and now we're debt-free!" The reader needs the middle -- the month it almost didn't work, the fight about Christmas spending, the time the car broke down and the emergency fund was only $200. The middle is where trust lives.

### The Guilt Test

Read the piece as someone who is $20,000 in debt, living paycheck to paycheck, wondering if they can afford to give anything at all. Ask: **Do they feel invited to start, or ashamed they haven't?**

If the answer is shame -- rewrite. Every piece must have an on-ramp for the person at the bottom of the mountain, not just advice for people who are already climbing.

---

## The Final Bar

Read the piece aloud.

If it sounds like a friend talking to you at a kitchen table about something that matters -- about money, about values, about the life you're trying to build -- publish it.

If it sounds like a finance blog -- rewrite it.
